OK, I really like the new IM feature in Gmail, but I hate the fact I don&#8217;t have an option to turn off the little pop up bubbles that come up whenever you hover over a name; however, technology has come to the rescue where the Googlites have failed. Garett Rogers wrote [this][1] little grease monkey script to stop the pop ups (you can right click and install that if you like). Read the rest of the article [here][2]. Kudos to you Garett.
