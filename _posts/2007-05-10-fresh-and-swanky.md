Nothing really important, just crossed the 600-mile mark on my Yamaha. That&#8217;s right, first service and everything is Saturday. I felt the need to change the oil since it&#8217;s going to be over 600-miles by the time I get into the service place. As with any freakiod mechanic, I always feel the need to try out my handy work, including oil changes.

It reminded me of working on my old Grand Cherokee and how nice it ran right after a fresh oil change. Needless to say, riding the FZ6 right after an oil change brings the same sort of smile to your face :-).
