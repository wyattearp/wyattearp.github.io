I&#8217;ve had my same Windows XP and Office 2003 installation for at least 3 years and I have to say that I cannot understand why I have had to install at least 25 different releases of Microsoft&#8217;s Genuine Advantage software. Every time I need to do an update, &#8220;We need to make sure you&#8217;re version of Windows hasn&#8217;t been stolen since the last month you did an update.&#8221; It makes me the kind of nuts that only leads to carbines and random notes. I just don&#8217;t understand how I&#8217;m going to &#8216;re-steal&#8217; a version of Windows if I haven&#8217;t stolen it the first 25 times. And secondly, why in the hell would I steal it? You&#8217;re pretty damned optimistic there Microsoft if you think anyone would steal crap.
