Should it be &#8220;It&#8217;s More Alive&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s Aliver?&#8221; That I can&#8217;t really say. But after lots of pain and suffering combined with nothing to do at work, I finally brought life back into my server. Yes, I know it&#8217;s been running recently, but now it&#8217;s been taken off the oscilloscope and binary bit pump. What that means to you is bupkiss. But what it means to me is that my Mythtv box now functions again with all the bells and whistles that I had for it. There is one thing I would really like to do, and that&#8217;s actually have other audio (i.e. not TV) output through the PVR-350 but IVTV doesn&#8217;t really let you do that. I&#8217;m not really sure if you can do that at all, but it sounds like something that I should research. I&#8217;m willing to be that if Windows Media Center can do it, the open source guys can&#8217;t be too far behind. Maybe I&#8217;ll dedicate a little time to seeing if I can help out in making that a possibility.
