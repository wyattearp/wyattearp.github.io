I&#8217;m slightly conflicted. Getting messages from people you haven&#8217;t talked to in 5 years will do that to you though. It&#8217;s always really weird talking with someone you haven&#8217;t spoken too in a really long time, even more so when there was not a good ending to the last time that you spoke. This seems to happen to a lot of people and it just always reminds me of the &#8220;Jerry&#8230;.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Hello &#8230; Newman.&#8221; that was on Seinfeld. It&#8217;s like the conversation never really flows, sort of like trying to flush a block of wood through plumbing that&#8217;s way too small and then you have to call the Roto-rooter man and they ask you why you were trying to flush a 5 year old block of wood through and that you shouldn&#8217;t be bitter towards the block of wood after 5 years because you think it had an affair with the sink even though there was no soap to prove it all the while reminding yourself that the next time you&#8217;ll use the garbage disposal.

Not that this is what happened mind you, just what I think what someone would slip up and say on a dumb sitcom and using the number 5 because it was easy to get to. I mean, it&#8217;s just right there next to the 6, how could you not go for it? My situation revolves more around that after 5 years, I don&#8217;t feel bitter, but more perplexed. I guess it&#8217;s just me and my logic trying to make sense of things that would make someone&#8217;s brain give off the sound of tapioca with cashews being pressed through a screen door by a rabid chiuaua hopped up on speed. As best I can tell, the proof would go:

A -> true  
B -> true  
A && B -> false  
Bottom  
Someone is a pope

Well needless to say, I replied with a clunky, block of wood message, mainly for the hell of it. Maybe I replied because I am slightly OCD and I hate seeing stuff left half finished, but other than that I really don&#8217;t know why. But then again, I&#8217;m not really sure why I do many of the things that I do. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not the pope.
