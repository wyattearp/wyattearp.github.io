To everyone out there &#8230; especially the ones that don&#8217;t read this blog, I&#8217;d like to give you a small grain of wisdom. We are fortunate enough to live in a society where nearly every household has a car; however, it seems that some individuals are abusing their privileges of the motor vehicle. Since I don&#8217;t have enough hard disk space to hold a post that would list all my annoyances with the way that other people drive, I&#8217;m just going to pick one thing that bugs me. No, it&#8217;s not the number one thing; however, it&#8217;s close and I chosen it because I had to deal with it over and over again today.

Stop signs.  
<!--more-->

  
Stop signs are great. They keep our rude asses from whacking into each other on most of the time we obey them. There is one thing that I can&#8217;t get though &#8230; what fscked up drivers education school taught that you were supposed to clog up traffic and wait for EVERY car to clear the intersection before you could proceed??? I mean, where&#8217;s the logic? If you can go safely, and it&#8217;s your turn to go, and you won&#8217;t be interfering with the other person &#8230; why not just go and get the hell out of the way? I know that the less interaction at a stop sign, the less likely there will be an accident; however, when you factor in that you have 20 cars that all want to go straight &#8230; and you want to go straight &#8230; and the only other cars at the stop sign are the ones straight across from you and all those idiots want to do is go straight, I think you&#8217;re increasing the chances by adding more cars to the same general vicinity.

Just to let you know, I misspelled &#8220;straight&#8221; every time I typed it in the previous sentence.
