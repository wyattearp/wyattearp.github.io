I recently picked up an [Adafruit Feather HUZZAH](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266) with the intent of gluing it together with the SmartThings eco system. This presented an initial problem of needing to do SSDP based communications since that&#39;s how SmartThings likes to do LAN based communications. After digging a bit, it becamse clear I was going to have to make some modifications to the library.

Getting Ready for Development
----
1. Follow the instructions to get the standard ESP8266 Arduino package installed (see Adafruit)
1. Fork the repo on github
1. Change to the `cd ~/.arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.0.0` directory
1. Remove everything, `rm -rf *.*`
1. Clone the git repo you forked
1. In the `tools` directory, `./get.py` to get the required tools downloaded
1. Make code changes and then start hacking away

Implementing the SSDP Server
----
After I built my own, I finally saw that there was a ESPSSDP library that I could use, so I scrapped what I did (even though it was about 5% smaller) and figured that I&#39;d work on cleaning up the normal library so everyone else could maybe have the changes. First things first, we need a proper set of serial numbers, so now we can do this:

{% highlight cpp %}
// setup the SSDP information
SSDP.setHTTPPort(LISTEN_PORT);
SSDP.setName("Temperature and Humdity Sensor");
SSDP.setURL("index.html");
SSDP.setModelName("TandH");
SSDP.setModelNumber("v1");
SSDP.setModelURL("http://hackerforhire.org/TandHv1");
SSDP.setManufacturer("Hacker for Hire");
SSDP.setManufacturerURL("http://hackerforhire.org/");
// only in my repo for now
SSDP.setSerialNumber(ESP.getChipId());
SSDP.setDeviceType("urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:TemperatureSensor:1");
{% endhighlight %}

After poking some more at the SSDP library, I think I&#39;m going to add a function to adjust the timer refresh since there is no way that waking the system every 1000ms is going to let it live even close to a day on the battery.
