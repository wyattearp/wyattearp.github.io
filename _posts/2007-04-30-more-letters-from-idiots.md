Man &#8230; it seems like the more of these I post, the more morons actually send me emails asking if I&#8217;ll help them out. You&#8217;d think that whole part about reporting people to the FBI and letting the Military Commissions Act ruin their lives would bother most people &#8230; but not these brave sacks of stupid! Anyway, on to letters.

The Response:  
*Sure, no problem. First, open the site, you&#8217;ll notice that when you go to login, there are separate buttons for your login and one of them says &#8216;Editor Login.&#8217; Click that one. You&#8217;ll notice that if it fails, that&#8217;s probably because you&#8217;re not an editor. Fricken mob tactics in a scientific journal on biology &#8230; that&#8217;s sounds like a Far Side cartoon or something. What are you going to do anyway? Drown them in petri dishes? Snap their bean plans in half? Crush all the blue eyed fruit flies? Give me a break.*

I cannot assist you in this matter, if you&#8217;d to know why please read here: http://blog.hackerforhire.org/?page_id=153</p> 

Secondly, harassment should be dealt with by the local authorities; however, it is nearly impossible to harass someone as you are referring over a message board on the Internet (from the standard legal terms of what harassment is defined as). In this case, you would be looking more at a situation of slander or libel. Since your friend is the director of a film, this places him as a public figure and hence forth, the rules for slander are completely different (that&#8217;s why you can read all sorts of lies about politicians and movie stars).

Why should I stop harassing him if you pay me?

Well, first off Pete &#8230; you mind if I call you Bob? Well, first of Bob, I think there should be a post on that blog / Canadian Meat Council (CMC) site about how poor your spelling is. It&#8217;s really swell of you to want to take this all the way to the DA for your po-dunk trailer park you call a town. Maybe if you and your horn-dogging, embezzlers would stop doing moronic stuff, there might be a few less things on the blog. Secondly, how do you know they are lies? Maybe you&#8217;re just not happy to hear the truth and you&#8217;re overly delusional on what qualifies as &#8216;good people.&#8217; Can it be done? Sure. Am I going to do it? Hell no! And what&#8217;s all this cruft about not wanting to &#8216;take it down?&#8217; You want to get on and delete things &#8230; you mean take them down from the public eye? That&#8217;s taking it down isn&#8217;t it?

> my husband is cheating on me. can you help get into his myspace, its set to private. I want to be able to navigate through everything. how much will it cost? please let me know.

*Well, if he&#8217;s cheating on you, why in God&#8217;s name are you still in the relationship you dumb bimbo? Dumb his ass on the curb! Generally, cheating is grounds for divorce and since he&#8217;s doing the cheating, you can own all of his stuff if your lawyer doesn&#8217;t suck; however, I don&#8217;t think you are capable of that since **you posted this in a comment section where I was ridiculing other morons about asking me this crap!** Don&#8217;t believe me? Look at comment #5 [here.][1] You&#8217;re an absolute idiot. I bet you&#8217;ll even stay with your moron husband.*
