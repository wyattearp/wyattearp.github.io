Sometimes it&#8217;s the little things that count. Today, I added a nifty plugin to WordPress that allows you to preview your comment as you are typing it. Why you ask? Why not? Actually, it&#8217;s really handy if you are inserting actual html in to the comment like links and images (as you are allowed to do). So now when you type in a comment, it display exactly what it will look like when it&#8217;s posed to the site. [Props to Iacovos and Jeff][1] for a spiffy plugin.

However, I can&#8217;t just leave it to just do simple html &#8230; I need to add crushing value to anything I touch :twisted:. I&#8217;ve taken the chance to hack the source on their JavaScript that does the replacement of text so now when you type in the preview, not only do you get what you would see in html, but the emoticons for smile, sad, cool, evil, and twisted magically appear when you type them in. I&#8217;ll be adding the other 17 when I have time to edit all of them in and figure out a better way of doing the variable manipulations because it&#8217;s somewhat static at the moment. Let me know if you like the preview or not :-).
