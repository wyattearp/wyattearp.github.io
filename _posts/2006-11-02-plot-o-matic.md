In the process they sign a suicide pact with a nun, formerly of the president&#8217;s harem. By the end of the movie they have burned 4937 double agents and end up winning the admiration of their kind hearted prostitute, Madam Bovilla, living happily ever after &#8230; after they commit suicide with the nun at a fireworks factory in the most brilliant display of special effects this week.
