Wow &#8230; 2007 already and here I am with less stuff on my blog than I hoped. Things have been really busy lately so I&#8217;m just going to give you the drive by blogging version.

First up, congratulations to HTG and their purchase of a shinny new Sun Server. The thing fricken smokes! I swear I was about to be sucked into it when we booted it the first time. You can read more about that [here][1] &#8230; well, maybe. It is a short post.

In other news, we are now on release 0.3 of Project REM. There was a small spat between the group; however, that can pretty well be chalked up to stress from the holidays, server move, and taking on an ungodly number of points to complete for a delivery that happened to be a day to &#8220;early&#8221; (HTG, was on time &#8230; the client was not). Needless to say, trumpets sounded, people hugged, and life went back to normal after everyone got to say their piece (at least I hope so).

Going along with HTG, it&#8217;s now coming to tax season and unfortunately, this is one tax form I&#8217;m not ready to attack. I&#8217;m cool with doing my own 1040 and 1099 forms, but I&#8217;d prefer to make HTG&#8217;s first pseudo-fiscal year not be the first year we received an audit letter from the IRS. I have to say, I&#8217;m very impressed with the work that&#8217;s been accomplish and by the looks of it, we&#8217;re only going to have more fun as it goes along.

Lastly, I&#8217;ve got four resolutions that I&#8217;m trying to work on for the new year. First one is to eat more healthy foods like fruits and whole grain oats. Secondly, it&#8217;s to stop eating out so much at work since I know it&#8217;s not good for me and it&#8217;s just costing me more money. Thirdly, I&#8217;m going to attempt to get a more regular exercise schedule because it makes my head clearer to think and work. Lastly, I&#8217;m going to try and blog at least 3 times a week. And to help me keep track of how well I&#8217;m doing, there&#8217;s a sweet little app called [Joe&#8217;s Goals][2]. Basically, you set up some plus minus habits and it keeps track of them for you. It&#8217;s free, simple, and quick, go check it out.

That&#8217;s all for now, I&#8217;ll be back next week with the tale of my new fridge and oven.
