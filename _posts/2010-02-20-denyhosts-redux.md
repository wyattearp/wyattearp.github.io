It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve actually had to think about using [Denyhosts][1] and if you&#8217;ve read my [post before][2], you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;ll swear by it&#8217;s functionality.

Recently, we&#8217;ve been getting hit by lots of SSH brute force attacks at [HTG][3] &#8230; and hit hard. The most recent stat was more than 2400 failed login attempts from over 50 unique attackers in a 24 hour period. Most times, I don&#8217;t care as long as they don&#8217;t get in &#8230; but then I sat back and thought, &#8220;Man, those fsckers are probably costing on bandwidth somehow.&#8221; and that&#8217;s where I draw the line.

So once again, [Denyhosts][1] is up and running, more than 60 hosts have been banned just today and more are going to get taken down. Now, if only I could come up with a good *legal* reason to just give my servers the capability to attack back &#8230; but that&#8217;s not legal &#8230; yet.
