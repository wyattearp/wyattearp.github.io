That&#8217;s right, you heard it here first &#8230; well, some of you will. Others will have received IMs and phone calls depending on their accessibility at the time. However you got the news though, it&#8217;s still the same.

Of course, what would a new house be without a house party? Well, yes, it still would be a house, but with less fun. I think I&#8217;m looking at sometime in the beginning of March for the &#8220;real&#8221; party, depending on the amount of time it takes to do the rewiring and fun stuff of that nature; however, before I get to that point, the current schedule must be addressed, this included the re-wiring project that is on everybody&#8217;s mind. Maybe not everybody&#8217;s mind, but at least the people who plan to touch something electrical at my house. So here&#8217;s the skinny on the schedule:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Project</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <em>Completion Date</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Floor Refinishing
    </td>
    
    <td>
      2006-02-12
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Washer & Dryer
    </td>
    
    <td>
      2006-02-11
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Furnace Install
    </td>
    
    <td>
      2006-02-14
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Rewiring
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Tenative
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Right now, the big project is redoing the floors. I will be starting on them Friday night and hopefully we will be sanding by Saturday at noon with the hope of urethaning on Saturday night, Sunday morning time frame. I&#8217;ll be sending out the wiring invite shortly &#8230; get it? ðŸ˜ˆ

***UPDATE:*** It appears that there is going to be more effort involved in the floor to get it to sanding status so there will also be a floor staple pulling party. Anyone that would like to join, it starts at 6:00 PM Friday, February 10th, 2006 at my new place. Where is the new place you ask? Why, right [here.][1] And just in case you have an aversion to Google Maps, the address is:

6864 Sampson Ln.  
Cincinnati, OH 45236

Bring a staple puller and I&#8217;ll see you there.
