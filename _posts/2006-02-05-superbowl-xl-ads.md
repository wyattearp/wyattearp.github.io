As seen on [digg.com][1] and other various places around the Internet, the Superbowl XL commercials will be made available online from [ifilm.com][2]. Personally, I think this is great because now I don&#8217;t have to watch a crappy football game to get to what are generally considered the most creative commercial ads of the year.
