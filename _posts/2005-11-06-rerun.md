Well, I&#8217;ve not posted in a bit, but that&#8217;s because nothing has been new. I had to de-cable the same data center that I had to run cable in this last week. All of the cable had to be removed from these server racks and it was going to be thrown away. I repeat thrown away. It took me over and hour and a half to remove all this cable because they wouldn&#8217;t let me cut it. They couldn&#8217;t give me any good reason why, other than I wasn&#8217;t allowed. Mind you, this is crappy, untested, un-certified cable with all missing the little snag boots. After I got done I told them I could have had the job completed in an hour if they would have let me cut the cable. The response was, &#8220;Yeah, I was really thinking about letting you do that.&#8221; I&#8217;m sorry my friends, but that is just stupid. At least as I write this, Sara is flying through the air at break neck speeds on her way back from California. Then I&#8217;ll at least have someone to torment again :-).
