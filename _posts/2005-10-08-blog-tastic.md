So this is the product of boredom, gloomy Saturdays, and enough technology to choke a token ring connection. I honestly have no idea what I&#8217;m going to put on this thing, but apparently I got it into my head that I needed one. And on that point, I would like to say, there is a lot of crappy blog software out there. Maybe this is just for people who want to host their own blog and not use a service like Blogger, but I swear I went through about 15 different packages before I finally choose one that I liked (Kudos to Tim for letting me know about this one). But seriously, half the blogs that I installed stunk major stank. Most of them due to really bad code, but a lot of the other due to just poor layouts.

But at least it&#8217;s something that I wanted to work on unlike work has been for the last week. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, my &#8216;real&#8217; title at work is &#8216;Technical Janitor.&#8217; Basically, I get asked the proper way to resolve and issue, they ignore my suggestion, someone does it completely different and then after its all fscked up, I get called into fix it. According the the documentation though, I&#8217;m supposed to be a Security Analyst (I don&#8217;t see why they can&#8217;t call it Security Engineer or Architect, but whatever). And do you know what the Security Analyst has been doing the last week? Not security work. I&#8217;ve been labeling Ethernet cables and pulling them through a data center. Let me tell you, there is nothing like labeling lots of Ethernet cable to make you think about driving 90mph the wrong way down a rush hour traffic with your boss&#8217;s neck tied to your bumper by computer cables. Though on the bright side, I did get to tell my boss that I would quit his company if he every had another client try to make me do cabling again. In closing, I suggest that when you are fed up, you give your boss and ultimatum just to relieve some stress.
