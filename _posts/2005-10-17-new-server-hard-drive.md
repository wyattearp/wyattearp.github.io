Well, I finally got the new hard drive installed in the server, not that youÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢ll notice. However, now I can finally get my FTP site back up and running again. That will give me a good store for my music (yah iTunes!) as well as about 30 more hours on my MythTV box (when I get it back up and running). 

I really miss my MythTV box. Staying up late to watch all the cool shows is really kind of annoying these days because I really donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t like getting up in the morning thanks work. There seems to be some issue with the card that I have and it actually displaying information on the television, but IÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢m to lazy at the moment to go hook up the real monitor to it to see whatÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s going on. ItÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s sad to say, but I think that IÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢m actually considering moving to Windows Media Center 2005 because of how much easier it is to get drivers that works. Then againÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¦I donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t want to get a blue screen of death when IÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢m trying to watch the absolute last showing of my crappy sitcom that would ever be seen on television
