Well, we are getting ready to head off to Mexico, Playa del Carmen to be specific. I&#8217;m going to try and keep the best journal / travel log as possible; however, I&#8217;m probably not going to get the chance to update my blog daily. The plan is to cram in as many details on where we went, pictures to prove that it happened, and all sorts of other gory details in case anyone else ever travels there <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Anyway, I&#8217;m going to finish packing and I&#8217;ll be back after I&#8217;ve hiked the ruins of the once mighty Mayan&#8217;s.
