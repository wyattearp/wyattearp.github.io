Today is a new day, or so it seem. I&#8217;ve been officially removed from the last client I was working at. Yes, that&#8217;s right, removed. Ousted, dropped, etc. While relieving in the fact that I won&#8217;t have to go to a client where I&#8217;m hated, I&#8217;m slightly frustrated in the fact that they are hiring someone else with more network management experience. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m going to say I&#8217;m all that and a bag of chips, but that I feel these people really are dorks. I found out that the director of our client contacted another client of ours and had words and found out that I didn&#8217;t have as much experience in the Cisco realm as the guy who had been doing it for 10 years. Really? You think? Go fricken figure. But that&#8217;s completely worthless at this point because I&#8217;m very happy I don&#8217;t have to go there anymore. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever experienced it or not, but walking into a place where everyone dislikes you and you are the communal scapegoat is not something I enjoy waking up for in the morning. Come to think of it, there is an even bigger reason behind why I was unhappy there.

I&#8217;ve seen many sides of the computer spectrum. I&#8217;ve worked mainly in the IT and support side, and studied in the theoretical and software design side. From this, I&#8217;ve come to determine that I hate IT. I love the security portion of it, but that&#8217;s all. None of the rest holds any value to me (this was determined as we went around the meeting table for the 7th time over the same 3 bullet items). When I think about all the fun things that I had done in school, the ones that were the most fun were designing and bringing to life software. Not just any old hacked out code, but something that you could see and interact with and had so much though and engineering in it, you couldn&#8217;t help but marvel at the amount of effort that the individuals put forth. That to me was awesome, not going around all day doing the never ending support tasks that eventually build up. Maybe I&#8217;m just tired of being around non-innovative people. Nothing in IT is ever created. It&#8217;s installed, patched, configured, operated, maintained, and crashed. I think I need to find my way out of this mess and into something that has a bit more creative license (just not too much, cause we all know what code with &#8220;too&#8221; much creative license looks like).

**UPDATE 10-24-2005**  
It seems that the fates have spit in my face once again. Apparently, as the last indigent jab towards me from this client, I have to return the client to direct and shadow the engineer that is supposed to be replacing me. I need to leave before this gets worse.
