[[adult swim]][1] has decided to star running old episodes of Pee-wee&#8217;s Playhouse. My dear God in heaven, that show is fscked up beyond all belief. I&#8217;m thoroughly impressed that someone hasn&#8217;t used watching that show as an excuse for drinking goat blood while clubbing baby seals or something just as peculiar.

I really am trying to come up with more to write about this &#8230; but my mind is still in shock from seeing it on TV last night. The only thing I can come up with is that if dancing clay food in your refrigerator having a &#8220;foam-whip-cream&#8221; party isn&#8217;t entertaining to you, you&#8217;ve been deadened to the world.
