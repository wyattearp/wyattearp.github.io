Merry whatever it is you are down with celebrating. Sara and I managed to make it to five Christmas-es in two days this year. That&#8217;s a record for us. I hope that you aren&#8217;t wasting your time today reading this as I&#8217;m not wasting my time writing this. Truth be told, I wrote this on the 23rd, but I&#8217;m just now getting enough time to actually release it out because I had no idea how many places we were going to make it.

All that aside, I hope that you have a wonderful day of your belief structure and that you friends and family do as well.

Oh yeah &#8230; screw you all you political correctness bastards! Merry Christmas!
