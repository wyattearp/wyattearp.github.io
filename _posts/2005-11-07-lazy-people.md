Cabling an entire data center gives you a lot of time to think. Mainly about how many different ways you could maim your boss and get away with it, but other things as well. Today I was thinking about how lazy people annoy the flipping crap out of me. One of the big ones is the stupid &#8220;Handicap Accessible&#8221; buttons that are placed on many doors. Generally, these buttons are about 6-8 feet away from the door. Now this is the part that I don&#8217;t get. People will walk the extra 6 feet out of the way, wait for 10 seconds for the door to open instead of just opening the door by hand. It&#8217;s kind of like tearing apart the whole living room to find the remote and walking by the TV 5 times while you are looking for it. I for the life of me cannot see the logic in it. But what really irks me about it is when this non-handicapped moron in front of me has to go push the stupid button, I have to wait and waste my time while this mofo meanders through the slow opening door. But it&#8217;s even better when the button doesn&#8217;t work. They push it and walk towards the door and when it doesn&#8217;t open, they walk back and push it again. Sometimes twice if they are really stupid. Then, when the door doesn&#8217;t open, it&#8217;s usually followed by a sigh of exhasperation and them slowly going to open the door because it&#8217;s just so damn hard to pull open a door. No wonder a third of America suffers from obesity if most of us are too lazy to open our own door. People should get flogged for being that stupid; however, if you listen to &#8220;They Might Be Giants,&#8221; you should know that:
