Maybe I&#8217;m just a freak and have a really sensitive nose &#8230; then again maybe I&#8217;m just a freak. Moving along though, I cannot stand stinky people. Not just the people who put way too much &#8220;Ode to Ratspit&#8221; on, but also those fine people who leave a plume of toxicity in their wake (a much larger group than you might think).

First up are the people that smoke. I love my family, but god help me, I can&#8217;t stand their smoking. My aunt smokes this one cigarette that smells like dirty socks being burned in a skunk fire and it makes me want to gag. I still cannot figure out how people continue to spend the price of a gallon of gas on stupid tiny paper sticks. For god sake, go smoke a glad plug-in or one of those stupid little pine trees that people hang from their mirrors.

The other one I absolutely cannot stand is body odour also known as BO. BO plagues those of us with sensitive noses on a daily basis. I can even tell when I stink even though other people around me say that they can smell nothing. There is nothing that drives me nuts to a higher level than to be at some place, enjoying the fresh air, when someone comes along and fowls it with their very presence. That&#8217;s fricken nasty!!! Take a shower! Hell, take five of them! Just wash that crap off and use some stink-be-gone. Do you think we are China and someone has for the first time in history introduced deodorant to our populous? And NO you are not allowed to use the excuse &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s the food I eat that makes me smell that way.&#8221; That&#8217;s a simple fix &#8230; don&#8217;t eat stinky food! Besides, that&#8217;s bull anyway. I&#8217;ve known man people who eat some nasty ass stank and they don&#8217;t smell like a foot. Now I know there are people out there with genuine medical conditions that cause them to be stinky bastards and to that I say, &#8220;Go get some damn pills and some soap! You&#8217;re stinkin&#8217; up the place!&#8221;

Thus concludes my public service announcement. Many of you may think this is a harsh approach, and maybe it is; but rest assured, it&#8217;s an equal harsh approach.
