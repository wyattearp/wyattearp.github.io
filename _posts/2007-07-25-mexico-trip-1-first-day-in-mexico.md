As we were sitting at the Delta hub, waiting for our plane, it occurred to me that I don&#8217;t really do well with being patient at the airport (much less other places). Sitting around waiting was terribly annoying; however, I found a cool, pseudo-useless gadget &#8230; the Quick Charger! It&#8217;s a nifty little do-dad that ou can pay $3 to charge your device of preference for 30min. The best part was that there are about 20 cable that are 6&#8243; long to plug your whatever in. I figure that this must be some sort of marketing major&#8217;s idea because it had blinking light, neon, shinny stuff, and other sort of seizure hoopla all over it, but only a few places to actually &#8220;hold&#8221; your gadget. So I guess the idea is that you pay $3 to stand for 30 minutes at the airport holding your cellphone into the precariously designed metal sticks whilst being accosted by the seizure box. I can imagine it would be more entertaining to have 20 people trying to use this magic box at the same time. Man, I would pay for that picture &#8230; 15-20 business people trying to charge & email on their BlackBerrys while a gang of 12 year olds fight to get the last iPod jack &#8230; and they are epilepting. But now its time to get on the plane and actually get the heck out of dodge.

Just one more side note, I found that Continetial allows GPS usage after 10,000 ft. As you can imagine, I was extremely disappointed that I didn&#8217;t own a GPS because I would have loved nothing more that to provide our exact path in GPS way points for our entire trip. Oh well, maybe I&#8217;ll get lucky an find one from Crazy McSanchezes House of Stuff for the return trip.

Spending time on a flight to Mexico takes up a lot of time in my opinion. I don&#8217;t see why jets aren&#8217;t faster. They need like an extreme class for passengers like myself where they subject you to Mach 70 speeds and throw you out of the rocket with a parachute and scuba gear; however, it does give me time to enjoy the meal on the jet. My favorite part is the &#8220;after dinner trash n&#8217; smash challenge.&#8221; Basically, I attempt to compact everything into the smallest package possible. It&#8217;s extremely reminiscent of my days in Philmont when the various base-camps would require your trash to be so compacted it would bounce before you could throw it in their dumpster &#8230; not something trivial when you are trying to pack/hike around garbage for 16 people.

So back to the ADTnS Challenge. For the meal, a turkey sandwich &#8230; trash left:

  * 1 sandwich wrapper with sticker
  * 1 1oz Frito Lay bag
  * 1 Milky way wrapper, fun size
  * 1 Mayo packet, Lite
  * 1 4.5&#8243; x 6.5&#8243; x 1.5&#8243; food tray
  * 1 SOLO cup with 3 cubes of ice
  * 2 small napkins

Trash Smashing Strategy:

  * Fold napkins into tiny fourths
  * Mayo packet horizontal at the bottom of the Frito bag
  * Insert napkins into Milky way wrapper
  * Align Milky way with Mayo
  * Roll up Frito bag and then fold into thirds
  * Chipotle-burrito wrap sandwich paper around Frito bag
  * Secure with sticker
  * **Final Size Estimate:** 8-10 inside tiny tray or 3 inside cup after the ice melts

At this point, it&#8217;s time for us to fill out the customs forms for entering the country. Never having done this before, I didn&#8217;t have a fricken pen and of course they ran out of them. While filling out the form, I came to the great revelation that: a) I don&#8217;t remember any Spanish and b) I hate forms. We landed on what I could only describe as a parking lot big enough to fit 1/2 of a 727, but hey, still in one piece. The customs experience was without issue other than me getting a dirty look because &#8220;I&#8221; didn&#8217;t push the button on the conveyor belt that &#8220;they&#8221; scan your luggage with. What the significance of me pushing the button is I&#8217;ll never know.

Since we needed to get to Playa del Carmen from Cazumel, we had to get to the ferry, and to get to the ferry, you have to take a bus &#8230; and by bus, I mean a cargo van packed with like 12 other fat Americans. Our driver took our bags and put them in and then we piled in the van &#8230; and then more people came and it was just a hoot to be in the van, er, bus. So Speedy Gonzolas&#8217; distant relative is driving us around and all the sudden we stop in this back ally. The driver gets out and the guy in front of me gets out &#8230; and they just leave &#8230; to the local brew through and come back with 2 12packs of Sol and start passing them out in the car. I&#8217;ve never been more freaked out in my life. First because there was alcohol in the car (no the driver didn&#8217;t have any, they all just drive like they are trashed) and secondly because all I could think of was getting tossed in jail for an open container in Mexico. Eventually, we were ejected at the site of the ferryy (only $10 to get to Playa) and crossed the channel. Our hotel was about 16 blocks up from where we docked so we got hazed by all of the street vendors, something you&#8217;d better get used to if you go to Mexico <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Once we got to the hotel, we pretty much crashed (it was such a nice hotel, Aventura de Mexicana) and turned on the Mexican commercials about &#8220;[Liftys][1].&#8221; No where in America would the FCC let you get away with a commercial about anti-boob sag products &#8230; but hey, it&#8217;s Mexico and if you buy a set now, they throw in a free set of &#8220;diamond cutter reducers.&#8221; (Yes, the video is censored, but I wouldn&#8217;t watch it at work.)
