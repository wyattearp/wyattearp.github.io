Apparently, [Google.com][1] has developed a small glitch for today. Twitter and [Tech Crunch][2] are reporting that Google has labeled even itself as a possible malware site. I think it&#8217;s probably due to their server that does the malware checking being down (giving me 502&#8217;s). Here&#8217;s hoping they get it fixed shortly.
