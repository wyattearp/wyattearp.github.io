Alright, I goofed and accidentally updated a stable revision that I thought was being tested correctly and well &#8230; it wasn&#8217;t. So if you&#8217;re having issues with [Code Snippet][1], just roll back to version 2.1.5 and life should be better.

Sorry for the screw up, but this has actually brought to light some bugs I never even knew were there so I&#8217;ll have those fixed up soon and we&#8217;ll be rolling again.

Download for 2.1.5 is here[: http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/codesnippet-20.2.1.5.zip][2]
