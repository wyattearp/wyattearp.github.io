Alright, reader interaction time!

Imagine the FBI is coming to interview you about me and ask you what kind of person I am to determine if I should receive security clearances or not. What story would you tell them about me? Feel free to fictionize where needed. (If I get the job where I need this, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll regret doing this later <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )
