OK, I&#8217;ve had enough people ask me for this that I&#8217;m going to post it instead of searching my email or hard drive for it; hopefully, someone will like the recipe <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So here&#8217;s the deal, you have two components to the rum cake. The cake and the topping. The idea is that you cook the cake and just before it is finishes you cook start the topping so that it is hot and ready to go when the cake comes out of the oven. You can put it together two ways:

  1. **Easy way**: Remove the cake from the pan, pour topping over cake and cover with topping. Cover it with plastic wrap to help make the cake more moist. I make two toppings in this case to make sure that it&#8217;s very moist.
  2. **Hard way**: Pour topping over cake in bunt pan. Let cool for about 5-10 minutes and remove the cake from the pan CAREFULLY. This generally yields a moister cake (with only 1 topping mixture) but causes the cake to break apart easier when removed from the pan due to the sticky topping.

Cake  
&#8212;&#8212;-  
1 box golden butter cake mix  
1 box Jello instant vanilla pudding  
1/2c water  
1/2c oil  
1/2c rum  
4 eggs

Blend until mostly smooth and bake at 325F for ~30 minutes in VERY well greased bunt cake pan; prepare topping just before cake finishes!

Topping  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;  
1 stick butter  
1c sugar  
1/4c rum  
1/4c water

Boil 2~3 minutes and pour over hot cake
