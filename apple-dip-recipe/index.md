So when I went to my cousin&#8217;s party this last weekend, my aunt had made the best apple dip that I&#8217;ve ever had in my life. Being as it&#8217;s that good, I thought that I would share the recipe with you and hopefully you could have some apple-dippy-goodness-tastic-action yourself.

**Ingredients**  
1 8oz Package Creme Cheese  
1/2 cup Brown Sugar  
1/4 cup Sugar  
1 teaspoon Vanilla  
1 package Heath Toffee Bits (milk chocolate)  
3 Tsp of Fresh Fruit (power mix that prevents fruit from browning)  
6 Apples 

**Instructions (as if you needed any)**  
Mix the creme cheese, sugars, vanilla, and heath bits until it turns into a nice paste. Mix the 3 Tsp of Fresh Fruit in a bowl with about 2 quarts of water. Cut apples in to pieces and drop into the water until ready to serve.
