Last night we got to check the beer and it&#8217;s done!

Pre-bottling taste test seems to show that it has a very smooth amber-styled ale flavor with the essential hoppie notes. I hope it will taste as good if not better after fermented in the bottles for a few weeks!

That&#8217;s it! Success has been had and I&#8217;m definitely going to do this again with everything that I&#8217;ve learned from this experience (a.k.a., no candy thermometers).
