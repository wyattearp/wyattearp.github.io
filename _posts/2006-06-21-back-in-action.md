I finally received my laptop back from Pomeroy (only took two weeks to replace a hard drive and an LCD panel). I have to say, the level of workmanship that I received was close enough to make me rethink the bad things I&#8217;ve heard/said about Pomeroy. Other than a really crappy job of putting the screw covers back on, my laptop is back to it&#8217;s previous functionality &#8230; minus any operating systems. Yeah, I was one of those people that actually DoD++ wiped my system before I handed it over the support. Call me paranoid, but I don&#8217;t want to be one of these people with their hard drive from BestBuy up for sale on eBay.

Now I&#8217;m in the process of rebuild my new primary OS (Gentoo Linux) because now I no longer have to use my system for work and I can run whatever I damn well please on it :-). I&#8217;ll have a post about my XGL experience and how awful that was when I get back from California and Rick&#8217;s wedding. And being as I&#8217;m going away, there will be no posts until probably next Monday. Have a good week.
