Being as I&#8217;m going to attempt a foray into developing applications for the iPhone and since [my development efforts for Symbian seemed pointless][1], I figured I should try and collect my resources into one spot. The other advantage with having a page is that maybe some other frustrated developer will come and say &#8220;NO YOU FOOL!!! Do it this way!&#8221;

**Basic iPhone Development Tools**

  * [Official Apple iPhone Dev Site][2]

**iPhone Application Development**

  * [iPhone Memory Management][3]
  * My [Hello World][4] application that shows something more useful (such as working with memory)
  * [Someone who knows a heck of a lot more than I][5]
  * [iPhone SDK Users Group][6]

**iPhone Web Development**

  * [iPhone Web Development with Ajaxian][7] 
  * [Detecting an iPhone][8]
  * [iPhone favicon][9]
