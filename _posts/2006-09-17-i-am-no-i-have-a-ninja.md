I finally got my Ninja back after nearly two years. It rode pretty good and the guy did a really nice job on it. I was still a little miffed that it took so long and there are still some things to fix on it; however, it came back better than the impression I was given over the phone. I got to ride it back to my Dad&#8217;s house and then we trailered down to Cincinnati where I need to go get the title transferred so I can sell it next riding season. I really wish I had more to write about this, but I don&#8217;t &#8230; so I&#8217;m done.
