Yep, that&#8217;s right. CompUSA came in sucking again as per usual. If you&#8217;ve read my &#8220;[Black Friday][1]&#8221; post, you&#8217;ll know that I had an o-so-fun time at CompUSA. If you haven&#8217;t read it, you really need too. The comment that I got back was that &#8220;I would be willing to go do that again just to see how you would write up what happened.&#8221; Anyway, this is the closure to that story that some of you may have felt was missing &#8230; mainly my DVD player.

Well because it&#8217;s the holidays and I am my usual helpful self, I was doing a favor for my Dad&#8217;s friend and taking him an Ipod Nano that couldn&#8217;t be found anywhere in northern Ohio. I couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere here in southern Ohio either, even after calling all the the stores I could think of. I finally got smart and called the Apple store who said &#8220;Sure, what color do you want it in?&#8221; So I was transporting the Ipod to its new owner in Dayton and I thought that it would be a great time to check in with CompUSA and find out why I haven&#8217;t had a call on my rain check item.

The service counter had some lady that was complaining about being a nanny for five kids and how her life was a sob story, but that didn&#8217;t matter to me, I was going to bust some skulls over a DVD player. My turn comes up, I ask for my DVD player, they say its still on back order. Now mind you, this is the &#8220;truck that just didn&#8217;t make it yesterday&#8221; that has now been not making it for almost a month. Don&#8217;t people check up on these things? I mean doesn&#8217;t Bob the truck driver&#8217;s family call CompUSA and wonder where in the hell Bob has been for the past month? Bob&#8217;s probably down in fscking Mexico sucking down a Corona and buying drugs with all the cash he got for his swag of CompUSA merchandise. Anyway, the DVD player is still on back order. I ask if they can substitute it, but they can&#8217;t. This is the only brand that won&#8217;t allow substitutions. Finally, I asked what needed to happen for me to walk out with my DVD player and they told me the best they could do was refund my money because I had to pre-pay for device (otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the sale price). Disgruntled and disheartened, I reluctantly said that I wanted my money back, know how much of a pain in the ass it was going to get another DVD player from the packed stores on the 23rd of December.

I thought that I was off to deal with that pain way too soon though &#8230; CompUSA still had some pain to dish out. Apparently, they couldn&#8217;t refund my money because I owed them 25 cents. Backup a second, I already paid for this, and now I want what I paid for back &#8230; does anyone else see where I&#8217;m going with this? Why can&#8217;t they just refund me my money that they have? I mean, whether or not I give them 25 cents, I&#8217;m still getting that 25 cents back. My exact question was, &#8220;So, do I just need to give you a quarter and then you are going to give it back to me.&#8221; As you can imagine, the response was &#8220;Yes,&#8221; though not quite that simple.

Apparently there was a billing problem where the amount in one computer was different than the amount in the other computer. The register said that I owed nothing, but the main database said I owed the 25 cents. Standing around on the phone for a half an hour followed. Finally, the issue was &#8220;resolved&#8221; in their database (a.k.a help-desk person added 25 cents after being unable to see what the hell happened). Going over to the check out, they couldn&#8217;t refund my money because the price was off by &#8230; you guessed it, 25 cents. Only this time, CompUSA now owed me 25 cents. The floor manager who had been aiding us through this process made a smart move and said &#8220;For the love of God, just give him the 25 cents,&#8221; and the girl did.

Now I had another problem, I had no DVD player, and it was 4:00 P.M. the Friday before Christmas at the Dayton Mall area. Anyone with half a stem cell for a brain can see this is not going to be a fun time. So I take off, spend my time in traffic and try to get over to Circuit City. Well, I can&#8217;t do that because some idiot have blocked the driveway to Circuit City by driving in the wrong lane. So I wave and motion and do everything else in my power to silently persuade the morons to get out of my way so I can drive down the driveway. No luck. At this point, I&#8217;m fed up. I shifted in to first, drove over the concrete barriers, though the snow, through the mud and all the while driving with my fingers out the window yelling &#8220;Two lanes!!!&#8221; Got to Circuit City, got my stuff and I left. I&#8217;m never going to CompUSA again.

The only thing that gives me some satisfaction is that I got 25 cents and that Bob will probably get capped for creeping into a neighborhood gang&#8217;s loot distribution territory.
