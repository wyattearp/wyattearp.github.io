Recently, Sara picked up &#8220;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&#8221; by Steven Covey. If you&#8217;ve never read it, go down to your local used book store and pickup a copy. It&#8217;s worth it in ways I can&#8217;t begin to touch here; however, it&#8217;s reminded me that maybe I need to go back to the 7th habit, &#8220;Sharpening the Saw.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve been looking at my skills set over the few short years that I&#8217;ve been working and I&#8217;d have to say, I think I&#8217;ve done a relatively good job at broadening my skills; however, I don&#8217;t really feel that I&#8217;ve become anything close to a subject matter expert. Still, remembering Henry Ford&#8217;s quote on being an expert:

> None of our men are &#8220;experts.&#8221; We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert&#8211;because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job. A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient he is. Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the &#8220;expert&#8221; state of mind a great number of things become impossible.

I feel that I&#8217;m still in that place where I think that I can accomplish anything &#8230; but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m really getting that from work. I&#8217;d have to say, I&#8217;m a little unimpressed with some of the work I&#8217;ve been doing. I&#8217;m not sure if I think it&#8217;s below me or if I&#8217;m just not appreciating the project on a greater scope. I&#8217;m fairly certain the work isn&#8217;t below me, since I find myself regularly challenged to come up with a unique solution to some interesting problems; however, I feel that I&#8217;ve got a pretty good picture of what is going on in the project. I&#8217;m probably just getting bored with it, though that&#8217;s not the case with HTG.

Right now, I think HTG is at a very critical point in it&#8217;s existence. For as many things that I we we are doing correctly, I&#8217;m seeing a ton more that we are missing completely and I really think it&#8217;s going to bite us later. It&#8217;s especially hard for me since we don&#8217;t really have a true leader of the group and attempting to play that ever now and again just isn&#8217;t cutting it; yet, I don&#8217;t feel that I can just step up and say &#8220;This is what we are doing and here&#8217;s the path we are going to take to get there.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve got a really good idea of what I want HTG to become, but it&#8217;s not all mine and I need step back and let things take their course. It&#8217;s just very difficult for me since I think I fall in the the &#8220;extremely competitive&#8221; category and that drives me to want to make it a success beyond successes. Unfortunately, this also means that I have this want for the members of my team to want the same success and to want to do whatever it takes to make the project success. In reality, that&#8217;s not something everyone is willing to do and it&#8217;s not a realistic expectation to have, and that&#8217;s not a bad thing, it&#8217;s just very hard when I want something for them more than they do. Alright, I&#8217;m done &#8230; and if you&#8217;re from HTG, this isn&#8217;t something slamming your performance, it&#8217;s just a general release on why I get frustrated from time to time &#8230; I know I have my fair share of times that I need to bring more to the table.
