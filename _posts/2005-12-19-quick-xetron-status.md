This is just a really quick one because I forgot to post this last week. Basically, I got a call from Xetron and the gentleman told me that I would have to wait until the second week of January to hear anything about the possibility of a position. Now of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m going to get a job with them, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that I won&#8217;t get a job with them either. I was also told that I was a favored candidate so hopefully there will be lots of security code in my future.
