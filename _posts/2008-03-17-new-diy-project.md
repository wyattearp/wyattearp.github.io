For some reason, I&#8217;ve got it in my head that I need a &#8220;fun&#8221; project to take up the remainder of my free time. I think it&#8217;s going to be a homebrew/DIY snake camera. Something like [this][1], but with the ability to mechanically bend it&#8217;s head and assembled for way less cash and from parts I have lying around. If anyone has any links to anything like this already, let me know so I can stop wasting my time dreaming up a design &#8230; but I&#8217;ve not found anything &#8230; yet.
