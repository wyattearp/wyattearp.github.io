Well, this has been the first disaster / power outage HTG has weathered since we&#8217;ve moved to [Profitability.net][1] and I have to say I&#8217;m stunned. More than 600,000 people are currently without power all over the tri-county area thanks to Hurricane Ike &#8230; but HTG has had zero down time.

Kudos [Profitability.net][1], you guys rock.
