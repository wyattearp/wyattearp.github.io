So today is officially one and a half weeks since my interview at Xetron. Technically, I could call back and say, &#8220;What&#8217;s up g-funk?,&#8221; but I think I&#8217;m going to hold off. You have no idea how much self control that takes. Especially when you are running on a limited amount of self control such as myself. It&#8217;s beginning to make me feel week&#8230;like I could afford to just go out and buy that 52&#8243; TV. But I&#8217;ll resist&#8230;for now. I&#8217;m really just at work and am very bored, but I&#8217;m working on a very nice, very long tirade, so be ready.
