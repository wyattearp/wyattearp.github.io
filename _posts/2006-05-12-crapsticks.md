Well, I&#8217;m sorry about that. As you probably didn&#8217;t notice, I killed the server. Fortunately, Sara was home so she could reboot it (it took the second time, not her fault). It would have been back right away if I had given Sara the right instruction to reboot it AND I had actually built in the right ACPI so that it would reboot with a proper shutdown by pressing the reset key &#8230; not by holding the key for 10 seconds and having it blowup. I do have some good posts coming up though, so keep your eyes peeled &#8230; not literally though, you won&#8217;t be able to read.
