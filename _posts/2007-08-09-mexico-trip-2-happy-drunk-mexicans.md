It&#8217;s not until you can&#8217;t have something that you really start to crave it (many people do this with sex or air I&#8217;ve been told). I really had no idea how much I would miss water, let alone how much of it I drink in a day, until I couldn&#8217;t get it anywhere without purchasing it in a bottle. After the second coke / beer / Chamoy-martini (a very &#8220;mexican&#8221; drink as it was described), I was jonesin&#8217; for some high quality H2O. The chances of someone blackmailing me with pictures of me &#8230; doing whatever, are zero in comparison for how quickly I&#8217;d sell out for a tank of ice cold water.

It probably didn&#8217;t help me that I spent the most blistering part of the day walking around Playa for shopping and then laying out by (not in) the pool, but we did manage to pickup a really nice silver bracelet for pretty cheap and a nice Mayian calendar for some wall at home. It occurs to me that while in Playa, being out before 6PM is a really terrible idea because it&#8217;s just nuts hot; however, after that life becomes more bearable.

We decided to hit Italian for dinner (yeah, in Mexico, yuk it up) at a place called &#8216;Salute.&#8217; This place is know for it&#8217;s martinis and our hotel was kind enough to get up two free ones just for showing up and eating. Their signature drink is called the &#8216;Chamoy Martini&#8217; and is described as &#8220;very&#8221; Mexican &#8230; translation, fricken spicy. It&#8217;s kind of like a good tasting bloody Mary, but with an instant burn instead of the Tabasco-lingering affect. Two cokes, two nice entrees and 2 free martinis came out to ~$40 American by the time tip as added. Not to shabby for the amazingly upscale joint that we were eating at; however, it didn&#8217;t have the same botulism feel that the $7pesos taco stand had. We decided that &#8220;Don Marios&#8221; on 8th and 10th had some pretty decent Mexican food, without the fear of extreme food poisoning.

Rounding out the day was a nice walk down 5th street to find the 7/11 with bottled water; however, we ended up walking all the way down town without finding the damn place (yeah, it was over in Cozumel &#8230; oops). Against my better judgment, I purchased a real, honest to goodness Cuban cigar. Now, I&#8217;m no smoker &#8230; heck, I&#8217;ve never smoked anything other than second hand smoke in my entire life, but I figured this would be the one time in my life that I would get to try something you can&#8217;t get (legally) in America. More on that after I try it. After we got back from our excursion down the street, we took a bunch of cool night shots at the hotel. Tomorrow, we pickup the Wrangler & head off to Chitzen Itza.
