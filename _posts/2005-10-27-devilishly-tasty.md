Ah, once again, Scott Adams saves what I could chalk up to another horrible day at work. Today, Scott&#8217;s [post][1] is about his bad thoughts that he&#8217;s had. Having worked at a place that I absolutely hate for 3 weeks, I can easily relate. So I present to you, my devilishly tasty evil thoughts of the week.

**1. Phone Numbers & Sticky Notes**  
Recently, a friend of mine got into a tiff with his female companion. Short story long, he got slipped a phone number slipped into his coat without his knowledge and his girlfriend found it and made a slight fuss over the matter and the fact that he shouldn&#8217;t have been encouraging another girl to continue flirting with him by speaking with her; this whole time my friend claiming his innocence and all that fun jazz that everyone knows girls care nothing about. Follow? Ok, so my idea is to find a bunch of girls and get them to write down some phone number with a smiley face or a heart, hit them with a blast of &#8220;Ode to rockin&#8217; the pony,&#8221; and slip them in his jacket when he&#8217;s not looking. It&#8217;s not that I really want to be evil/mean to him, but that he just presents himself as a really good target this time around.

**2. Smoking**  
I was browsing the internet when I found [these][2]. The website pretty much says it all (until the link goes down so I&#8217;ll digress &#8220;ab ovo usque ad mala&#8221;). If you&#8217;ve ever seen a WB cartoon from back in the day, ([this][3] guy is so wrong) you&#8217;ve more than likely seen the exploding cigar. Well, these cigarette loads allow you to be your own animated character for bargain price. I can almost imagine how entertaining it would be to stick about 12 of these buggers in one cigarette and watch the persons hair singe as the cigarette erupted into a magnificent snow storm of tobacco and carcinogens falling lightly too the table. I can even imagine how much more fun this would be if the person were going to the airport&#8230;.

**3. Hand Sanitizer**  
So as always, I&#8217;m generally scraping the bottom of the barrel for the third thing, but technically I count the cigarette loads as two because one is at home and the other as the airport. Basically, I feel no shame for the cop-out on this one. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen anyone use the hand sanitizer stuff, but we had some of it in the office and being as my job is horrible and I had nothing to do, my engineering curiosity got the best of me. I&#8217;ve noticed that it has just a slightly thicker consistency than the KY warming liquid you see the girl rub on her fingers in the commercial. Go find the commercial [here][4] and watch it if you don&#8217;t believe me. So enter the idea, find some jerks hand sanitizer and replace it with KY warming gel. Notice I said gel and not liquid, you don&#8217;t want it running out all over the place. But the instant it hits their hands, they will know something is up &#8230; so will anyone who shakes hands with them the rest of the day. Now that, my friends, is making sure the evil is evenly distributed.

**4. Poof! I had another.**  
Well, I just happen to have one more that I thought of in a parking lot (don&#8217;t good ideas always come to you in strange places?). Apparently, you can rent these &#8216;flash boxes&#8217; used in photography studios. You can also swing by any Walmart and get a power inverter for your car. Aim it out the rear or back passenger window of your car and attach the remote trigger near your horn. Wait for a dark night. I can just hear the conversation with the officer later at night:

> Victim: Everthing was going fine, I was on my cell phone and then there was just this bright flash from no where and I drove into the wall.  
> Cop: Yeah, sure buddy, a flash from no where. And where did you say the aliens left Jimmy Hoffa&#8217;s body? 

That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;m not responsible for any of this if you try it and all that other fun stuff.
