Screw people who talk about work in the damned restroom. When I go in there, I don&#8217;t want to hear about how your crap isn&#8217;t getting done while I&#8217;m trying head natures call. It&#8217;s rude, it&#8217;s annoying, and I&#8217;m fairly certain that if you talk about your work around where people take a shit, it will make your work shittier. And you know what else? Screw you even more for standing the middle of the door way while you talk about whatever is just so damned important it can&#8217;t wait 10 secs for some to take a piss.

Screw you. Screw you right in the ear.
