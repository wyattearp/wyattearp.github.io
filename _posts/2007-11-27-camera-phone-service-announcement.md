Ok, I understand that people like to take pictures with their camera phone, I&#8217;ve come to terms with that &#8230; barely; however, there is something I feel I need to say. If you are going to take pictures on your phone, expect that at some point in the future, someone WILL look at the pictures on your phone.

That being said, if you are going to take nude or possibly compromising photos &#8230; and leave your phone sitting out on somewhere with the camera running &#8230; you must naturally expect that someone is going to see those photos.

Just so you know, this is going to put whoever looks at the pictures is in a slightly awkward position &#8230; especially when you know that person. On another related noted, it also makes that original person who is now either quickly snapping the phone shut or staring at the train wreck a lot more uncomfortable when someone else comes up behind them and asks to see the photos or ask what they were looking at. Responding &#8220;It was \____ and \____ doing the horizontal mambo and their junk was hanging out all over the place.&#8221; doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue as well when you are serious about it ðŸ˜›

In reality, this goes for any digital-photography device. So on behalf of the world &#8230; don&#8217;t share that stuff unless you are sure the **others** would like to see it.
