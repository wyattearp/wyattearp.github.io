That&#8217;s right! I finally sold the Ninja. I sold it to some guy that apparently has a 1100 GSX that has nitrous on it and he wanted it for something smaller to cruise around. He came with a trailer and asked if he could hear it run. Sure enough, the silly thing fired up without issue after a jump and the guy said he&#8217;d take it. And with that &#8230; the Ninja is gone from my sights!

As soon as we get some sun shine, I&#8217;ll get some nice pretty pictures of the replacement ðŸ˜Ž
