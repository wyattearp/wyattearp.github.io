Wow &#8230; I never thought I would see it happen, but another couple of posts have over taken the FBI post in popularity. I guess it was bound to happen at some point in time; however, I wonder how much of it is due to way that the new popularity engine ranks things. It is &#8220;improved&#8221; in the way that it doesn&#8217;t count when I click on a post, but it seems like it&#8217;s adding in other ways. I guess I&#8217;ll have to tweak the settings to make it more accurate.

But what is really surprising is that my &#8220;Disturbed, Yet Flavorful&#8221; post is ranking in as the most front page clicks of any post to date. Personally, I didn&#8217;t think that it was really that good, but hey, the numbers don&#8217;t lie. Apparently, you people come here to get evil ideas (either that or there is a plot to throw me awry in my inane ramblings).

Being as I&#8217;m a people pleaser (for intellectual types only, idiots get no pleasure on my watch), I will do my best to try and bring you more evil ideas. In response to the comments on my previous post, I will also do my best to make sure that I present enough background and detail for any of my stories/rants to be cleverly misconstrued as a real article written by someone that may have passed college English. Thanks for the feedback :-)!
