Today I really felt like walking out on work. I mean really just saying &#8220;You know what, I&#8217;m done. No, the job is not done, I am.&#8221; and leaving the crack heads to do their own crap. That&#8217;s what it really boils down to. I&#8217;ve noticed that the people I&#8217;m working with simply don&#8217;t do this job because they know it sucks. I can&#8217;t blame them for that, but I can blame them for wasting my time and talent. I can also blame my boss for that. He has no respect for me. I think that&#8217;s what really just cheeses me off to no end. 

As I stood running cable all day, all I could think of is how much I couldn&#8217;t wait to tell him I&#8217;m leaving. I have to admit, I was coming up with some pretty dramatic ways to do it too. All the way from:

Me: Knock, Knock  
Boss: Who&#8217;s there?  
Me: No one you freak, I&#8217;m leaving you high and dry.&#8221; 

to 

Me: You remember how you said you were looking to hire another engineer?  
Boss: Yeah?  
Me: Yeah, make it two.

to

Me: You know, you&#8217;re OK as a person, but my god, you suck at trying to run a business.

I would venture to say that it&#8217;s getting really bad when all you can do is think about how you want to tell your boss that you quit. I swear I was so angry that I couldn&#8217;t even see well enough to peel the stupid little labels that I had to make for each one of the networking cables. Especially when I had to go hunt down one of the stupid cables because some other moron put it in the wrong rack. It&#8217;s really twisting my anger twisty too that I keep working through my lunch hour so I can get the heck out of this place by using up their block hours. You think they would notice if I put nooses at the ends of all the cables? Oh, I have a better one. I think I&#8217;m going to start braiding the cables as I run them. And every 3rd cable will be the wrong one from another server rack on the other side of the data center that was suspiciously run underneath the floor and magically wound itself in to a knot of malice and jovial kinkification.

On a brighter note, I got an email from a professor at UC that is in need of people to work at non-sucktastic jobs. I also got a call from Scott&#8217;s in Dublin (not that I really want to move) for an interview. Still nothing from Xetron though :(. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to hope they call me up tomorrow while I&#8217;m at the INFRA Guard meeting with Greg and ask me for an interview. Another side note is that I&#8217;m taking resumes to the INFRA Guard meeting and there is a good possibility that my boss will be there. What&#8217;s he going to do? Fire me? Go ahead, I triple dawg dare him. Though, it would be nice to see the look of hurt and the tear in his eye from knowing that he ran his business into the ground faster than a flaming train wreck of French anarchists toasted off of PCP wielding baguettes as middle fingers.
