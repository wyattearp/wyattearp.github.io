## UPDATE &#8211; 2015-05-01

The latest version, v2.1 is now available in the play store: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hackerforhire.msbandlight>. This version now includes full lighting on the screen!

This application will allow the installation and removal of a &#8220;Flash Light&#8221; tile on your band simply by clicking on your listed band when it is connected (remember, you have to have your band joined to your phone). Again, the interface is extremely simple.

Installation of Tile:

  1. Click the band that you would like to install the tile on
  2. Click that you **Allow** the installation of the tile

Removal of the Tile

  1. Click the band you would like the tile removed from
  2. The tile is removed

**Don&#8217;t forget you need this application or Microsoft Health to remove the tile**. If you install the tile and then uninstall this application, you&#8217;ll have to re-install the application or use another  tile manager to remove the Flash Light tile (such as Microsoft Health)
