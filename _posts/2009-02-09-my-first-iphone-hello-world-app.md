I finally managed to get a functional &#8220;hello world&#8221; app created for the iPhone and added up on my site. The problem I was having was not only were several tutorials out on the Internet incorrect (i.e., using really old unsupported techniques), but Apple&#8217;s code didn&#8217;t quite seem to give me enough information.

I started mine completely from scratch with an Xcode iPhone view based application, went through the process of adding my *IBOutlet* connecting it up, and then took the extra step of exercising some memory management in Cocoa Touch (something I couldn&#8217;t find many places). I&#8217;ve tacked it up on my [iPhone development section][1] for your viewing pleasure.
