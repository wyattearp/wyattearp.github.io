Today, I got an email with a file attached asking me to open it to view some &#8220;pictures.&#8221; Man &#8230; I was so excited. I very rarely get viruses or spyware sent to me these days since the email servers clean most of them out &#8230; but I got one!!!

The zip file contained one file, **film.src**. A careful user would have hopefully just deleted this email, being as they didn&#8217;t expect it *and* it came from an unknown person &#8230; take that as a security tidbit for free. The observant, yet careless user, would have opened the email looking for picture and saw a screen saver and wondered what the hell was up. This user opened up the file and tossed it into IDA Pro <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I&#8217;ll update if I find anything cool <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
