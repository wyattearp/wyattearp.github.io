As you may or may not know, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati and I am a member of the Alumni Society. Being a member is supposed to grant you benefits like having your Bearcat ID still active as well as other privileges.

Knowing this &#8220;fact,&#8221; I told Sara I would get a book for her from the biology library to aid her in completing her paper. I should have known that it was going to be a bad experience when I started out at the main library on campus instead of the biology one. After the nice young lady at the front desk conveniently pointed out that the book I was looking for was in the biology library as stated on my cheat sheet given to me by Sara, I went over to the biology to pickup the book; however, there was one small problem. The biology library doesn&#8217;t open until 13:00 even though their website says that it opens at 12:00. This tends to get in the way of progress at 12:30. So I wait and eventually get in only to find that I can get the book &#8230; but I can&#8217;t check it out.

According to the system, my ID is no longer registered. Strike one against the Alumni Association. Being the industrious person I am, I decided to copy the book using the remaining $5 on my ID. ERRRTT, Wrong! When you card is inactive, you can&#8217;t use the cash that is on it even though the system will tell you exactly how much money is left on the card. Strike two.

Fortunately, I had a smart person (Sara) tell me to take the sack-o-change with me to do the copies just in case it didn&#8217;t work. Needless to say, the rest is relatively inferable; however, I did have another fight with the gate in the parking garage. It seems that even though the system takes Bearcat ID, Visa, and MasterCard &#8230; only MasterCard seemed to be working that day. Man &#8230; I miss dealing with this malarkey day in and day out &#8230; NOT!
