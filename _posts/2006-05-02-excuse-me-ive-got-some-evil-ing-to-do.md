In response to the statistics, I&#8217;m going to try and make sure there are plenty of evil ideas to go around for all; however, I think I&#8217;ll change things up just a touch. In the past, I&#8217;ve just put these ideas out here for all to read and have asked nothing in return &#8230; now that is going to change. I humbly ask that IF you read the following ideas that you please leave a comment if you have anything to say. By &#8220;anything to say,&#8221; I&#8217;m looking for productive comments. Not the &#8220;Oh this is so great ++digg&#8221; bull-crap, but suggestions on improving, varying, questions on specific ideas, or issues with implementations. The reasoning behind all of this is the hope that I can provided a better service by having another perspective on my thoughts and ideas. I&#8217;m also going to encourage you to write to me asking for assistance with specific situations that require the finesse of an evil twist (details within). And the last thing before we get into it &#8230; I am not responsible for anything you do or think about before/during/after reading this. That&#8217;s called a choice &#8230; and if you make the choice, then your responsible. Enough with the verbiage, let get on with the good stuff!

**1. Ton of Fun**  
Back when we were doing my Eagle Scout project, we had to purchase a ton of stone &#8230; not once, but twice (long story, ask me about it some other time). Why am I telling you this? Simply to let you know that two tons of stone only cost me $25. That&#8217;s right, only $25 for two tons of stone. If that doesn&#8217;t get your twisted brain thinking, I&#8217;m not sure what will. Basically, you can buy a ton of stone and go dump it in the yard of your nemesis for about $80 total if you rent a truck from Home Depot; you could make it cheaper if you had your own, but the dump bed is nice for a fast get away. Now if you come up with a good variation, let me know because stone is cheap when it comes to purchasing stuff for being evil.

**2. Wire you upset?**  
This one comes as a response to helping my friend clean up his yard. My friend&#8217;s neighbor is a very inconsiderate piano instructor. I can&#8217;t count the number of times that she has come over to complain about him taking down a tree that was nearly laying on top of his garage and how now her entire landscaping scheme was completely destroyed because of how much it change the lighting. &#8220;Bah!&#8221; I say! So for this to work, you need someone who plays piano and plays it often and a screw driver (one with quick bits would be a big help here). Gaining access to their house can be an issue; however, some social engineering should get you in. When you have the chance, open up the piano and just randomly pick some screws that adjust the tuning of the strings and give them a 1/4 turn in what ever direction you fancy at the moment. Try get as many stings as you can, favoring the middle set of chords as they are generally played the most (generally). Your results will vary, but for the most part, you should make the person&#8217;s musical ear want to tear itself off his or her head and drown in a pool of bad clarinet music.

**3. Emails**  
For the more technologically inclined, it&#8217;s sometimes easier for us to take vengeance upon the mere mortal users of our systems. If you&#8217;ve never faked an email, it&#8217;s really not that hard. Here are the basic steps (from a high level):

  1. Look up their DNS record for their mail server
  2. Telnet to the server on port 25
  3. Send an email from whoever you want to be to your victim
  4. Sit back and watch

Now, I&#8217;m not going to tell you exactly how to do this (too many OS and tool choices for brevity). Another thing to keep in mind is that your IP address, which identifies you on a network, will be logged somewhere. There are ways around that, but you&#8217;re going to have to find them yourself.

&#8212;

Alright, that concluded the most recent evil ideas. If you have a specific situation you&#8217;d like me to address, feel free to give me an email at **wyatt at hackerforhire dot org** and I will do my best to help you out from an thinking perspective (no, I won&#8217;t help you do anything to anyone, I have my own aggenda)
