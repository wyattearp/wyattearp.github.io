I think that there are really more than 5 senses that the human body has. Personally, I donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t know how many I have for sure, but I know itÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s a number greater than 5. One of that has been going off a lot recently is the ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâYouÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢re going to screw meÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ sense. I donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t know if anyone else has such a refined sense of it as me, but I think everyone has felt it at some point in time.

You know the feeling too. Sometimes you are talking with someone, sometimes all you have to do is look at them and you know that this person is not going to help add to your general happiness quota for the day. I have several really good examples and of course, I am going to share them with you.

**Tall Timbers Apartments**  
When we first met the land lord of these apartments, I had a bad feeling that she was going to do everything in her power to essentially screw us over. I donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t know if it was the way that she talked or the ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâIÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢m going to charge you out the assÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ smell she carried with her, but I was affirmed of my suspicions shortly after when they were the only place out of the many we visited that was going to charge us back rent for the last 4 days of July as well as the 4 days worth of backed water billing (a whole $3.01). I also got another hefty dose of stank when it took over a month and a half to repair the dishwasher. The common belief was that they were waiting on us to vacate at the end of January so they wouldnÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t have to pay to fix it. The whole ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâWe will send you a notice that says you should have given us 30 days notice of your leaving 15 days ago so now you have pay next months rentÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ was another kicker. That and the sending me notices that I havenÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t paid my water bill on the 3rd of the month when they donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t send me the bill until the 17th.

**IHOP**  
Admittedly, Sara got the short end of the stick on this one; however, I knew the waitress was going to bone us over the table the moment we walked in the door. She gave that look of ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâI canÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t believe that YOU people are coming in here to eat.ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ They served me warm apple juice but they really took the screwing to Sara. First off, our food took forever to get (eggs and French toast). Secondly, they brought her French toast out without any topping because she didnÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t specifically ask for one and the waitress didnÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t specifically point out that she was specifically supposed to ask for what specific topping she wanted on it ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¦ specifically. Second, they asked her how she wanted her bacon (that she was giving to me) done, she said crispy. If it bends in fifty places when you pick it up, itÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s not crispy. IÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢m sure there was more, but I donÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢t remember. The last thing I remember was it took thirty minutes to get our check because our waitress was o-so busy bussing the other empty tables around us in her section.

**Work**  
I almost missed it on this one, but the nth-sense figured it out again. When I was approached about the CCNA, I was told that I we would ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâdiscussÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ possible compensation for completing the task. I prodded several times about the fact I had achieve this because the company asked me to, each time I receive the ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ãâwindow loveÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ or ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ãârespect knucklesÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ (depending on your movie reference) as a discussion ender. The whole discuss thing was what tipped me off to begin with; however, I should have been able to prevent some of this. In retrospect, I should have negotiated the terms up front instead of just blindly completing the task. Lesson learned, always get the statement of work up front.
