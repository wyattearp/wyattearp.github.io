Well, it&#8217;s taken one and a half years, but I finally got my Xserve running. Not just running mind you, but running the latest and greatest version of OS X. Now I know most people reading this would be like &#8220;Shesh Wyatt, it took you how long to install the operating system that is supposed to be so easy to use blah blah blah&#8230;&#8221; Well shut up you poop face lickers! I just finally got drive space for it, not to mention the time to actually work on it. Add in the fact that I had to &#8220;special order&#8221; a part from Apple so that it would run an Apple OS in any small fashion, buy new RAM so it wouldn&#8217;t crash every time that I try to boot the CD&#8217;s that I also had to &#8220;special order&#8221; from Apple and finally &#8220;special order&#8221; imaginary firmware so that the system would actually see the drives so I could actually install and I would say that it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;just that easy.&#8221;

Normal people would have given up and went out and bought one that just worked, but as we all know, there&#8217;s no way in hell that I&#8217;m normal. ðŸ˜Ž
