Hacker for Hire is now pleased to bring you full service domain, web, and email hosting. Prices vary from free to &#8220;why don&#8217;t I just run my own server?&#8221; That&#8217;s really all I have. If you&#8217;d like more information, you know the email. Oh, this service will probably be &#8220;sold&#8221; (a.k.a. haucked, chucked, lobbed) to HTG, Limited when we get underway.
