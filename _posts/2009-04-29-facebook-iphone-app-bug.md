Dear Facebook,

Your iPhone app is great &#8230; almost. Please fix the extremely annoying bug that doesn&#8217;t allow me to use apostrophes. It&#8217;s really annoying to have to type out &#8220;does not&#8221; or &#8220;do not&#8221; in place of &#8220;doesn&#8217;t&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t.&#8221; I know, I could override the auto suggest and go with &#8220;dont,&#8221; but that just pisses me off. I already commit enough infractions against the English language without purposefully littering misspellings all over just because your application has to stupidly provide a server error every time I include an apostrophe in a comment.

Sincerely,

Wyatt
