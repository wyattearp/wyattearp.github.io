Now I know that I really hate cabling. Here&#8217;s how it works out:

Each cable requires 4 labels  
Each server has 3 cables  
Each rack has about 15 servers  
There are 6 racks in a row  
There are 5 rows in the data center

3 x 15 x 6 x 5 = 1350 cables total that I have pulled  
1350 x 4 = 5400 labels that I will have printed

As to the total number of feet, the racks are setup something like this in feet:  
11 15 19 23 27 31  
13 17 21 25 29 33  
15 19 23 27 31 35  
17 21 25 29 33 37

A quick hit to Excel gives us 1728 feet of cable per row of servers (3 cables a piece) &#8230; times 5 rows that I&#8217;ve been working on gives us 8640 feet of cable, roughly.

To put that into perspective its:  
1.64 miles  
28.8 football fields in length  
420 times taller than me  
69,120 peanuts laid end to end, assuming a peanut is 1.5&#8243; long
