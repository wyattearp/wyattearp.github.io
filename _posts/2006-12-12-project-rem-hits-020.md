That&#8217;s right, our second iteration for the REM project has been completed. What is the REM project you ask &#8230; sorry, can&#8217;t tell you, that&#8217;s proprietary and you&#8217;d need to sign an NDA &#8230; nah, I kid. While I don&#8217;t want to spill all the beans, I will say that we are working on an web-based, AJAX-ie-nebulous type of application that will hopefully kick some major booty down here in the Tri-state area &#8230; those of you who know what it is and what it does &#8230; keep &#8216;yer yaps shut until we get so far ahead of the competition that Google decides to buy us ;-).

The big things that I&#8217;ve taken away from this project already are:

  * 1. How cool agile programing approaches are.
  * 2. How badly there is a need for a standard for Java-scriptish libraries.
We&#8217;ve been working with the [Dojo Toolkit][1] and while it is very robust &#8230; the voodoo that one must conjure into making things function is unbelievable. From functions that die magically in the middle of running without warning (check your commas (,) in JavaScript) to things like programmatically creating a pop up dialog widget only to have it cover your &#8220;user input&#8221; area because there is a magic order to doing it one way over the other, Dojo is filled with all sorts of things that would make a lesser programmer cry. Still &#8230; it is better than writing it by hand and pseudo-object oriented programming is better than nothing. Anyways, I&#8217;ll have another post up shortly about some idiots that have come across my site, but haven&#8217;t managed to read my blog (oh yeah, you know what I&#8217;m talking about :cool:).
