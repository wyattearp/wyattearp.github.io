Well, since the plane trip to Aruba is going to be a long one &#8230; anyone have some suggested reading?

Someone has suggested **The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense**; however, I was considering something more along the lines of **Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering**.

I&#8217;ve previously gone through **The Shellcoder&#8217;s Handbook** and it was good (minus the code mistakes). So instead of watching [Ask a Ninja][1] and other DVD&#8217;s any ideas of books?
