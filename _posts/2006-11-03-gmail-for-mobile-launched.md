&#8220;Gmail for Mobile&#8221; is something I&#8217;ve been looking forward to for a while. I must say I&#8217;m very impressed. I was a little panicked when I went to log in and there was no &#8220;save my password&#8221; check box, but that is some magic that happens in the background :-). Browsing messages looks beautiful on my Nokia E60. I love that a lot of the AJAX-ey sort of stuff like showing multiple messages, searching through contacts, clicking on messages and having them expand just like they do in Gmail. It really provides a very crisp and responsive user interface. I also like the fact that I can view *most* attachments right in the application itself. Here&#8217;s a link if you want to download it directly to your computer to hack around with:
