When Google Notebook first came out, one of the biggest flaws was that searching for something in would only tell you what notebook it was in, not take you too it in your notebook &#8230; something that&#8217;s a PITA for those of use with more than a screen full of entries. It now provides the notebook as well as the item you searched for. I still think that they should move away from the seperate notebooks and go with the &#8220;Labels&#8221; system like Gmail has for what notebook something is in as well as which items are public.
