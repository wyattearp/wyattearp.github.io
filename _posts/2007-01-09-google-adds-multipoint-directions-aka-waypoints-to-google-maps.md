Google has added a feature I&#8217;ve been crying for since the advent of Google Maps &#8230; way points. In Google terms, they call them Multipoints, but it doesn&#8217;t matter, the functionality is still there. No only can you specify multiple places you want to go, but it&#8217;s only a drag-and-drop movement to change your route and have it automatically updated. Check it out for yourself by going to [Google Maps][1] and firing up the directions.
