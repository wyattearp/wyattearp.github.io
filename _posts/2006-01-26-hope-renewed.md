Just a really quick blurb this time. Xetron called me back again, not to offer me a job to my dismay, but to verify some information on my application. I take this to be a good sign, though Art is going to be in super big trouble if he keep calling me Neal Wyatt. I can only imagine the kind of stupid issues that would cause filling out security forms backwards like that. I&#8217;d have like an Isbecagechastanian sniper after me or something because of it.
