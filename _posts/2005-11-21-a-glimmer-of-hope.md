Bo-fricken-ya!!! After a great wailing gnashing of teeth, Xetron finally called me for an interview. Now on to the fun part, trying to get the job. I&#8217;m generally not one to get super excited about interviews, but I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t say I was totally amped about this one. The ideal situation (which I know is not going to happen) is that I will have my interview tomorrow, go do my crappy CAPC stuff in the afternoon and get a call on Wednesday that say &#8220;Hello Mr. Latest Xetron employee, we&#8217;d like to welcome you aboard. That would make &#8220;Nerd&#8217;s Night Out&#8221; that much cooler cause then I could say all kinds of stupid crap like &#8220;I would tell you that, but then I&#8217;d have to kill you.&#8221; Though, I guess I wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to kill them, I don&#8217;t think you get that privilege on your security clearances, even though you should. However, I imagine that there would be a lot of charred, smoking vehicles on the way to Xetron and other places that work on security projects for the U.S. Government on the days that the engineers just couldn&#8217;t handle the road-rage and had to retaliate with their hood mounted IABMs (Interautomotive Ballistic Missiles). I&#8217;ll keep you posted on if things go really well or if I&#8217;ll have to go back to the &#8220;Office Space&#8221; hellhole.
