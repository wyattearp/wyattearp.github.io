Now that&#8217;s what I call an interview. It was challenging in the questions that they asked, but satisfying in that I had all the right answers (well, at least I think that I did). I met with 3 individuals who work there and though they couldn&#8217;t tell me much more than &#8220;what we do is really cool,&#8221; I think that it would be an awesome place to work. One of the most interesting questions that I was asked was &#8220;How would you go about determining what this unknown virus does?&#8221; Unknown viruses??? That&#8217;s fricken BA (bad ass, I shortened it just like Dane)! All this reverse engineering sounds so fricken cool! I&#8217;m sorry, but this job just sounds uber cool! Hopefully, they will call back soon (about 2 weeks I&#8217;m told after all the paperwork and whatnot). I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
