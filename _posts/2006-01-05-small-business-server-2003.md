I know you&#8217;ve been there. Someone adds a bunch of hype to a technology and makes it sound super cool and that you just have to have it. But then you get it and find out what a huge disappointment it really is. Small Business Server from Microsoft is one of those pieces of crap like that. Yes, I&#8217;ve had the fortune to install three of these devil worshiping boxes and I am tired of the taint it leaves behind. Executive types think that this is just an amazing product and it offers everything that they are looking for &#8230; and they might be right, but only for a short time.

See, there are lots of things wrong with SBS. Lots. So much I&#8217;m not going to get into it because I&#8217;ll just be even more pissed that I had to deal with it. But I think that it&#8217;s very unfair to advertise it as a system that just works when it doesn&#8217;t even install without error, prevents users from manually changing things, requiring a DHCP server to be installed so you can &#8220;Connect to the Internet,&#8221; and a slew of other horridly stupid ideas. The whole thing is that everything that is on SBS isn&#8217;t meant to play together at all, but though some voodoo magic, Microsoft summons the wandering spirit of a crippled street urchin to hold the system together.

I am so tired of crappy technology, aren&#8217;t you?
