  User participation time ... what would your response be to "I'm getting a lot of spam on my handheld and PC" ... of course, feel free to assume that you don't care if you work for this company or not (like me :-)).

Recently, [userfriendly.org][1] has hit the spam topic ([here][2],[here][3], and [here][4]) and today it has come to hit me as well. My boss came to me and asked me to setup our Exchange server to use this RBL system and possible screw up our entire email functionality for 24 hours. Of course, I&#8217;m not going to do it because I don&#8217;t care that much that he&#8217;s getting all sorts of spam on his handheld and PC (same email box, no crap you are getting them on both you turd bugler!) and I really don&#8217;t feel like breaking a server I just got to functional yesterday.
