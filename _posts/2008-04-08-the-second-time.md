Today will mark the second time that I will have willingly yielded to an opponent based solely on the preferences of the other members of my group.

The last time I did this, I said that action of appeasement to a empty threat would provide a continued channel of abuse from a former customer; however, I was outvoted and went along with the consensus of the group. Four months went by and as I predicted, our former customer contacted us again to ask services we had provided once before. Again, I followed the actions of appeasement to &#8220;prevent any possible legal issues&#8221; that could arise.

You can say that I&#8217;m just being proud, headstrong, reckless, or whatever you&#8217;d like to call me. But I do not believe in being bullied. As is such, I have a very difficult time standing behind my decision. For some people standing behind something you don&#8217;t believe in doesn&#8217;t seem to be a very big deal; however, my conscious nags me to the point of insanity for following by decision I do not believe in.

That makes two. There will not be a third.
