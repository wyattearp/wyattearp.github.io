Well, if you&#8217;ve been following along with the saga of Wyatt, you will know that I&#8217;ve been forced to go back to the client that I was removed from because I was not producing the results desired by the client. In case you missed it, you can go read my rant [here][1].

Today, I returned to the client site to meet with, not the one, but the *two* engineers who would be replacing me. Seems kind of odd that I was not producing the desired results, yet the work I was doing required two engineers to replace me. But that&#8217;s neither here nor there, the important issue today is what actually happened on the client&#8217;s site. I should also note that my purpose for being on the client&#8217;s site today was to &#8216;learn&#8217; from the gentleman installing CiscoWorks and Cisco ACS. So I meet these two engineers (sounds like the opening to a bad joke), Wingus and Dingus (names have been changed to protect these idiots). Wingus went on to work on ACS and I joined Dingus to watch and learn on CiscoWorks. That didn&#8217;t really last much more than 5 minutes before I got a nice heap chuck from Dingus. So now I get to do the install, to which I question&#8230;why? I mean really, I&#8217;m supposed to be the one that was removed for not knowing how to accomplish this task and now I have to do it again. Does that make any sense to anyone out there on any level? If it does, you let me know and I&#8217;ll come and club you followed by a [pod][2] of baby seals to commemorate the impact you would have left on the world. So during the o-so not painful install process that goes through one CD about every 2 hours (that&#8217;s a 6 hour improvement from the Solaris installation) Dingus sits and watches me. Well, no wait, that&#8217;s incorrect. Dingus whined and complained about how horrible his computer was running and how he couldn&#8217;t install PCAnywhere to get access to the system and how he couldn&#8217;t get VNC to install on his system and how he could barely check his email and on and on all the while doing the &#8220;flop like a dead corpse that was just beat in the head with the butt of a shotgun&#8221; move and adding the &#8220;oh geez&#8221; sigh with the &#8220;rub my bald head like a bowling ball&#8221; for flair.

Dingus proceeded to do this approximately every 5 to 10 minutes while we (and I use that lightly) were installing CiscoWorks.

If you think that this is enough to drive someone ape-shit up a banana sandwich tree, you are right on the money. Ever 5 minutes he would come over and look at my screen because that&#8217;s where all the &#8220;action&#8221; of watching the installer bar move was. After which, he would proceed back to his chair to do his patented move once again. Just for my enjoyment I&#8217;m sure. Well, this went on for &#8230; the whole blasted day. Oh, forgot to mention that we had to go to Vernon Manor for lunch to have a really crappy buffet that cost nearly $10.00 and wasn&#8217;t worth a bum&#8217;s left index finger.

So at the end of the day, I got a call from my boss asking me how my learning went, to which I replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to call you back on that.&#8221; When I called and told him what had happened at the end of the day, he was pissed. First off, because there was only supposed to be one engineer billing time to the client. Second, because Dingus was absolutely worthless. Then he went off on how I was supposed to be there to learn and not be there to just install CiscoWorks by myself again. As the whole conversation wound down, he finally came to ask where we were at with the project. My response was &#8220;Exactly where I would have been if the client would have let me continue doing my job.&#8221;
