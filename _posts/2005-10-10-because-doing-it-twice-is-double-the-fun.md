Well, today was just another bang-up day at work. I spent the first 1/3 of my day going over a spread sheet that could have been written by a trained monkey. Sadly, I was the trained monkey that had to write the blasted thing. I would have to say that the second most boring thing to labeling Ethernet cable and running it all over a friggen&#8217; data center is writing down all the names of the servers and their IP addresses, something that should have been done back a long time ago. But, I will admit that it is my own fault. If I would have been the genius at VB script that I hoped I was, I could have written something that did the whole spread sheet, but Excel was not being my friend today.

That was good part of work today. The bad part was that I&#8217;ve been tasked with migrating 100+ DHCP scopes from an old CNR system to the new and busted Microsoft solution. Now, I should probably take that dig at Microsoft back considering that if I want to make a backup copy of the configuration, it&#8217;s 1 command, where in the CNR, I&#8217;ve yet to see it done. In fact, the official documentation of the CNR says [paraphrased], &#8220;don&#8217;t worry about backing up your configuration, just buy another server, spend many hours making it redundant and you&#8217;ll never have to worry about it.&#8221; For all those geeks out there, you will chuckle, the rest of you will will just think that I&#8217;m a geek; moving on. So I found a way to get a very sketchy configuration from the CNR server so that I could actually work on writing the script that will translate the configuration to the Microsoft brand. Later in the day, after I have been working on this for awhile (yeah, I had to try learning a new programing language because I thought it was too simple of a task), I find out that they have this information stored somewhere and that the format that I&#8217;m using will be completely wrong, but that I should continue on my project and they will get me the new format as soon as they can&#8230; This is one of those what you think, what you say ordeals.

What was said:  
Idiot: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get you a new format, but keep working on using the old format until I get you the new one.&#8221;  
Me: &#8220;Sure, I can do that no problem.&#8221;

What was thought:  
Idiot: &#8220;I&#8217;m a stu-pud idiot and by the way, I&#8217;m going to get you a new format, but keep working on using the old format until I get you the new one.&#8221;  
Me: &#8220;Sure, I can do that no problem. I mean I really love redoing all my work for no good reason. By the way, I will stab you in the jaw with a pen.&#8221;  
Idiot: &#8220;Ow!&#8230;Not the blue pen! Any color but the blue pen!&#8221;

And it&#8217;s not that I really think that the blue pen would hurt a hell of a lot more than a black one, I just happen to like the color better. So now at home, I&#8217;ve nothing all that incredible to do. I think that I will finally get around to upgrading my server so that my MythTV box will work again. I dread the thought of that though. In the past, I don&#8217;t think that &#8216;not well&#8217; even begins to describe how tinkering with the myth box goes. It usually goes, &#8220;Ah, now it works&#8230;wait&#8230;what the hell! Why can&#8217;t I use the remote&#8230;.no I can use the remote, just not the left half of it&#8230;wait, now the left half works but my website is all pink! Stupid fricken monkey ass myth box!&#8221;
