It&#8217;s always a pleasure to get something unexpected in your email. Today, the 61st edition of the DNRC newsletter was released to me, and I must say, it was good. Along with all the other fun stuff that comes with it, I found that Scott Adams, the creator of my role-model and hero, Dogbert, has now started his own [blog][1]. You&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;ve taken the chance to add it to my blog role. Although I don&#8217;t personally know Scott Adams, his quotes, such as this one, make me feel as if he was my crazy uncle that no one liked me hanging around, but I did it anyway so I could learn how to make armpit noises and tell fart jokes.

It&#8217;s statements like those that make me smile that sort of evil smile you get by smashing a kid&#8217;s ice cream cone into his face so he&#8217;ll remember you for the rest of his life.
