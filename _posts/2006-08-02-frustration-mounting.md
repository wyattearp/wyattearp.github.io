No, not the title to a bad porno &#8230; you sick freak. Just how I&#8217;ve been feeling lately. There&#8217;s been a ton of crap on my plate and the worst part is that I&#8217;ve not been getting much of it done. I&#8217;ve also been neglecting my outlet (aka, this blog) since I&#8217;ve been trying to come up with ideas for HTG as well as starting a new job &#8230; not that starting the new job should have any real affect on anything at this point (so far, two days and I&#8217;ve done nothing other than tell HR that I won&#8217;t molest people in an unethical manner while taking drugs, drinking poison, and ignoring a sign that says &#8220;Don&#8217;t Explode This!&#8221;) I even have another Evil Ideas themed post that is already written, just not edited.

All that aside, I really don&#8217;t think ignoring my stress outlet is that beneficial so keep your eyes open and you&#8217;ll see more. I&#8217;m out for tonight, I&#8217;ve got a long day of sitting around doing nothing tomorrow.
