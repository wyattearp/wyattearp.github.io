Booya &#8230; back in the saddle again! Sorry for the outage folks, but the migration of the hackerforhire.org domain is complete &#8230; that and the repairs to my fscking electricity are almost completed. The campaign (not just one battle mind you) will be up later after I pull these posts out of Word documents and blog-o-fy them.

This also means that HTG&#8217;s web hosting is now up and functional. It&#8217;s going to be a few days before we start offering services since we want to make sure that we are providing nothing but the best service (yeah, it sounds like marketing bull, but its the reason we&#8217;ve decided to do our own hosting instead of these other jokers) so stay tuned. Same bat time, same bat channel.
