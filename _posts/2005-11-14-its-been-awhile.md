Well, ti&#8217;s been a few days since my last post. Nothing too much has been going on. I&#8217;ve started up my technical support company again to get some extra cash and Ultimate Frisbee has been moved to Saturday, which is very disheartening. Both really. I&#8217;m not really all that big into doing the tech support stuff, but when people pay you $30 an hour for it, it&#8217;s not too bad of a gig. But I&#8217;m really crushed about having to move Ultimate Frisbee to Saturday. There was really no better stress outlet than a good game of UTF on Friday after a long week of horrible.

I&#8217;m considering giving my notice to CAPC this Wednesday because I can&#8217;t stand it anymore. I know that it would be jumping ship without having another job, but it&#8217;s getting really bad. I was recently asked why I was leaving, these are the &#8216;because&#8217;-es I came up with:

> Because I refuse to do cabling again  
> Because the boss is trying to hire someone that he can&#8217;t afford  
> Because the boss is trying to hire someone that he can&#8217;t use  
> Because the boss can&#8217;t run the business for squat  
> Because our internal infrastructure is shot to hell and no one cares  
> Because our business model is &#8220;Sell them everything&#8221;  
> Because our business cannot get beyond &#8220;We have to support everything&#8221;  
> Because everyday I don&#8217;t like being there more and more  
> Because the boss has assumed that I will not hold to my word and leave 

Those are the big ones. Mainly the last one. I told him if he ever made me run cable again, I would leave. I told him that three times that I would leave, but apparently, he doesn&#8217;t believe me. It&#8217;s unfortunate that I will have to resort to this to gain any respect, but I view it as better that I leave a company where I&#8217;m not respected. I think that&#8217;s what it really boils down to. There is no respect. But that would be too long for this post, so instead I&#8217;ll leave you with a current status of **Project FWANJ** (pronounced Fa-wan-gee).
