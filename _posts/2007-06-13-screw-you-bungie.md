The grand-fricken-pubah&#8217;s over at [Bungie][1] can kiss my ass! I pay $50 bucks a year to use the Xbox live service, I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to pay $4 for **2** more crappy ass maps so I can play Halo 2 online. I could play it online before, and I should still be able to play it online now. You can go straight to hell and when you get there, I&#8217;m going to make damn sure I&#8217;m the guy lashing your pasty white ass for this load of horse crap. Having &#8220;Premium&#8221; content for players to play in &#8220;Premium&#8221; areas is one thing; however, bending the average Halo player over, forcing them to purchase to play the standard array of services, and making them take it up the ass so you can drive two Porsches instead of one is crap of the highest degree.

Go F*ck yourselves you ass-blasting mongoloids . I hope to hell someone backs over your shit in the drive way when your loser lovers toss it out the second story window after they caught you taking it in the ear from the cat. When they do, call me, I&#8217;ll come over and piss on it and take a tire-iron to your knee.
