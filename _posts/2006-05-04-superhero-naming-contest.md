OK, here&#8217;s the deal &#8230; my step-father has a contest for work to come up with a new name for the &#8220;superhero&#8221; of their motivational bull crap in the grocery store. The current hero has been struck by lightning and they are either looking to replace him or give him a new name. The hero, &#8220;Captain Stop,&#8221; (stupid ass marketing majors) fights against &#8220;Snidely Shrink.&#8221; The thing you need to know is that &#8220;shrink&#8221; is basically the waste of product(s) in the business, that&#8217;s basically what &#8220;Captain Stop&#8221; fights.

Why is this important? Because I am challenging you to come up with more creative names that we came up with and submit them as comments (as man as you like per comment). Here&#8217;s the list we came up with, try and come up with more or vote for your favorite!
