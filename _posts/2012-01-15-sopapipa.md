If you haven&#8217;t heard about SOPA / PIPA, then you&#8217;ve probably been living under a rock for the past several weeks. I&#8217;m not going to talk about why it&#8217;s bad, or how it&#8217;s oppressing the freedoms provided by the internet because pretty much anyone who would even come across this site knows exactly what&#8217;s at stake.

Instead, I encourage you to contact your congressional representatives and light a fire under their asses to reconsider sanity once more as an option for governance.  If you want to know more about SOPA, click [here.][1]

As Americans, we continually take for granted the freedoms we have in the country for granted, everyday. Stop taking things for granted and start standing up for them; earn your keep Americans.
