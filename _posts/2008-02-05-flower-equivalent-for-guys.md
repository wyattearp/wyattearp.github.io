Well it&#8217;s February and that means that it&#8217;s that time of year again. Valentines day is coming and guys all over the are going to buying flowers for their significant others. But what do the girls get their guys (other than the obvious unmentionables :-))? Now, I know that the ladies always treat their men right, but what I&#8217;m looking for is the guy equivalent of flowers. It would have to be something simple, enjoyable, and doesn&#8217;t have to last for a very long &#8230; and I&#8217;ve got it ðŸ˜ˆ

A aerosol air-horn.

It totally fits the bill &#8230; simple, enjoyable, doesn&#8217;t last long, and plus it&#8217;s awesome. Trust me ladies, buy your guy one for V-day, he&#8217;ll love you for it <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
