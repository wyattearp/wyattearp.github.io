Bah&#8230;Blogs are dumb. Well, not all of them are dumb, just some things about a lot of them are dumb. Mainly, the fact that you have to click on the title of the post to leave a comment. I think i might just hack some java script in to it so that it gives you a cool little fade-in/fade-out box or some crap like that; something that parents and AOL users would forward off through an annoying email that says &#8220;Oooooo!!! Look at how it (insert whatever the hell it does here)!&#8221; Stupid bastards and their fricking monkeys&#8230;makes me want to go banana-sandwich. By the way, that&#8217;s 3 drinks talking.
