While writing on my cousin&#8217;s wall, I came across the following revelation and it seems rather accurate:

  * Warning: Pregnant women, the elderly, and children under 10 should avoid prolonged exposure to Facebook.
  * Caution: Facebook may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds.
  * Facebook contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.
  * Do not use Facebook on concrete.
  * Discontinue use of Facebook if any of the following occurs: 
      * itching
      * vertigo
      * dizziness
      * tingling in extremities
      * loss of balance or coordination
      * slurred speech
      * temporary blindness
      * profuse sweating
      * heart palpitations
  * If Facebook begins to smoke, get away immediately. Seek shelter and cover head.
  * Facebook may stick to certain types of skin.
  * When not in use, Facebook should be returned to its special container and kept under refrigeration. Failure to do so relieves the makers of Facebook, Mark &#8220;Big Daddy&#8221; Zuckerberg, and its parent company, Global Chemical Unlimited, of any and all liability.
  * Ingredients of Facebook include an unknown glowing substance which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.
  * Facebook has been shipped to our troops in Saudi Arabia and is also being dropped by our warplanes on Iraq.
  * Do not taunt Facebook.
  * Facebook comes with a lifetime guarantee.
