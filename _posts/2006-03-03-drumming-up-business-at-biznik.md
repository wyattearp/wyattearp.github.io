As our HTG Limited finally seems to be gather some steam, I figured that I might as well start killing down some potential customers. I say killing because hunting implies failure. In order to network and find some people that are hoping to find people of our skill, I&#8217;ve joined [biznik][1]. Supposedly, it doesn&#8217;t suck according to the tag line. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see on that; however, I am relatively impressed with the interface thus far as well as the search capabilities. I do think that it is missing a regional search type of function though (chances are someone will implement it later on down the line). Even if it fails to gather any business, it might be worth it to see what other people out there are really looking for.
