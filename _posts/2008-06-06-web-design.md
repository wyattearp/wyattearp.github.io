I don&#8217;t usually like to just copy and paste from other people&#8217;s sites; however, I think I&#8217;ll make an exception for this one given what I&#8217;ve been working on recently. At work, I&#8217;ve volunteered to write a process improvement for the design and development of web-based user interfaces and I have to say, this sums it up quite appropriately.
