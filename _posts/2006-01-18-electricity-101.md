By now, I&#8217;m sure you know that I&#8217;ve purchased a house. If you don&#8217;t know that then you are either: 

a.) an idiot  
b.) not reading my blog enough  
c.) some crazy guy named &#8220;Lulabell&#8221; from Isbecaskuchwanalaida  
d.) all of the above  
e.) all of the above except c, but including d

If you answered e, you really are an idiot and your IP will be blocked by my &#8230;. alright, enough stupidity, back to business. I&#8217;ve got a new house. One small problem. The wiring needs some medical attention. Not so much the first floor, but the second floor. So in light of a previous post, I&#8217;m throwing a rewiring party.

Yep, you heard it here first. The first ever wiring party. There will be food, drinks, and games like &#8220;try not to put a staple through the neutral hot wire.&#8221; But all that fun aside, the invite will be going out soon because [as cool as people think I am][1], I think it would be much more fun to have people there to help/watch/screw up.

Keep an eye out for your invitation &#8230; ðŸ˜Ž  
Read the FBI post to know what will happen to you if you turn it down &#8230; ðŸ˜ˆ
