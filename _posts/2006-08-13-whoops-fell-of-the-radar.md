Alrighty &#8230; I&#8217;m officially back on the blogosphere radar &#8230; and what better way to do it than to start off with a nice healthy rant :-). I mean, that is why I keep this around anyway right?  
<!--more-->

  
First up, I want to apologize to all the girls everywhere. I have been provided a brief glimpse into your world and I can completely sympathize with your situation &#8230; the people who make girls shoes suck! Dear lord do they ever suck. I swear, I think Sara and I have spent about 6 hours of our lives (that would be 12 hours collectively or 24.9 hours perceptively) trying to find new shoes for her at work. I can&#8217;t even count the number of places that we went trying to find some shoes that fit, didn&#8217;t look like they came out of the 1920&#8217;s, and looked somewhat stylish. To the engineer, this doesn&#8217;t seem like it would be that difficult of a task being as they sell shoes EVERYWHERE; however, after finally looking at women&#8217;s shoes, it be an understatement to say that 80% of the ones in the store blow banana chunks on a good day. So people who make the crappy shoes YOU SUCK! And to the girls that find ones that are sexy/stylish, carry on &#8230; just keep it under 20 pair per household.

Speaking of households, the wonderful people at the Sears company are going to get a nasty phone call tomorrow. I have had my card for at least 4 years and I don&#8217;t think there has been one year that they have actually billed me correctly. I got this bill last month for $75.00 on my 12 months same as cash 0% interest washer/dryer. Why? No one seems to know, but I have to pay it otherwise they&#8217;ll take my 12 month 0% away. That&#8217;s crap. I swear, as soon as American Express gives me another set of those 1.99% interest for 12 months deals, I&#8217;m going to tell Sears to cram it up the skinniest hole in their ass because I&#8217;d rather pay American Express than a bunch of fscking retards that can&#8217;t even get my bills right.

And of paying bills, I&#8217;m ready to thwack the guy who&#8217;s been working on my bike &#8230; apparently it&#8217;s &#8220;done&#8221; now. It&#8217;s going to cost me $400 more than it was originally as well as it&#8217;s not 100% fixed because the guy didn&#8217;t quite do what he said he was going to. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I trust the guy did good work on what he did, and I&#8217;m sure all that he did really needed to be done because the bike was in rough shape &#8230; but it irks me a little that he fixed stuff that I could have done myself. Since this venture has cost more than I really wanted it, that stupid ass bike is going on eBay. Send the link any of your enemies and tell them it&#8217;s a good deal, I&#8217;ll slide some your way.

Well, it&#8217;s not a ton of rant, but I didn&#8217;t want to melt your eyes after not seeing a rant for a long time. OH that reminds me &#8230; the people who wrote the API to OpenSSL &#8230; you need to be beaten for making 30 different ways to do the same damned thing. To all the people who write OpenSSL &#8220;tutorials&#8221; (and I use that extremely lightly), you all fscking suck donkey turd splats. You use SSL\_shutdown(SSL \*object) and not SSL\_free(SSL \*object) you dumb ass jerks! I swear, if I could get back 1 minute of the 160 I spent figuring that out, I would hunt you down and beat you with the pointy end of the &#8216;1&#8217;. Ok, I&#8217;m done. Stay tuned for more :-).
