Pretty sweet if you ask me, though there are a few limitations. Stuff like you have to use the service regularly and they reserve the right to limit the length of the call; however, what caught my eye was that I could have a phone number for $35 a month for unlimited call in. Not super useful by itself; however, if you are running a business where people call in and want to leave a message or something like that, it&#8217;s a perfect solution. Plus it&#8217;s also a good idea to help keep my personal number off of all this cruft I have to send in to make a business actually functional/legal.

It also gives me a geek out as well :-). Since my Nokia e60 is a SIP phone, I should be able to use it with my Gizmo account &#8230; should. Apparently, there is a NAT issue with the e-series that makes things a little difficult and I&#8217;ve not been able to get mine to connect yet; however, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before I resolve that issue. In the mean time, I&#8217;ve collected the best source of Nokia-SIP connection information off of some site that tries to print ever time I go to it. I&#8217;ve put it in my Google Notebook [here][1] for anyone else that might find it useful. When I get mine working, I&#8217;ll put up a step-by-step.
