I don&#8217;t normally re-link to other blogs unless I really think it&#8217;s worth mentioning; however, there is currently a debate between boxee and what I can only assume is a content provider over [here][1].

To me, it&#8217;s enlightening to the the other side of the arugument for a change. Generally, the only thing on the Internet is how the people on the Internet are always right and how other media/content providers are crazy. 

I&#8217;ve read through both sides and, well, I just can&#8217;t agree with the content providers. I&#8217;m all for a la carte and I personally find the arguments made by the content provider to just be frustrating. One in particular about how &#8220;consumers think they want a choice&#8221; really got me annoyed. The plays into my hatred of how media really helps control the way the brainless masses think; however, freeing up that thinking and allowing real choice and hopefully removing the brainless from the masses.
