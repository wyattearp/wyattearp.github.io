I know that I&#8217;ve done a terrible job at updating my blog with my latest rants, raves, recipes, and letters from retards; however, I&#8217;m going to change that for this year. You can call it a resolution, but the reality is that I miss writing about nit-wits <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So in an effort to kick it off right, I thought it might be a nice change of pace to show you just what kind of interesting stuff the blog gets to see, but no one else does.

**Top Search Term**  
This is the one that blew me away &#8230; top search phrases for this site are a riot

  1. apple dip recipe
  2. revenge stories
  3. hacker codes
  4. code snippet
  5. trac pam
  6. swfupload upload_script
  7. evil ideas
  8. ffmpeg 3gp codec
  9. use firefox to hack it someone&#8217;s myspace

Where the hell is &#8220;hacker codes&#8221; coming from??? I mean, it brings up the Code Snippet page &#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t even come close to what I would take that to mean. An the last one &#8230; that is my absolute favorite because there were at least 3 separate people that searched for that, 3 different IP&#8217;s on 3 different days (different states too). I have no idea how the hell someone would come the the conclusion that Firefox would be the best tool to &#8220;hack&#8221; MySpace.com, but just &#8230; wow. I see that I also need to increase my evil output as well from what the search results show.

**Most View Page [on site]**  
The page most clicked on, view, whatever-ed from the front page is &#8230; The Apple Dip recipe! Apparently, people love the apple dip so I&#8217;ll see what I can do to put up some new recipes at some point in time, but I never thought people would come here for food <img src="http://blog.hackerforhire.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Most View Page [referred]**  
The most view page &#8230; &#8220;Code Snippet 2.0&#8243; I&#8217;d have to say that hosting this plug-in has taken up more time that I could ever imagine; but it&#8217;s been so worth it. I really wish that I had time to do all the other fun things I&#8217;d want to with it, but sadly it gets a lower priority. From seeing the number of page views (3800+), I think that I&#8217;m going to have to do just a little bit more work on it.

That&#8217;s all I have for 2007, I hope that I&#8217;ll have more in 2008.
