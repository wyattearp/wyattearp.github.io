It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve had a week that just sucked &#8230; this last week must have been my payment for my suck-sabbatical. First off, work was annoying beyond belief. Not because of the work (no, that didn&#8217;t come until Friday), but because of redoing the schedule again and again. As if the beatings for being a &#8220;Junior Engineer&#8221; who is not working as efficiently as a &#8220;Senior Engineer&#8221; that hasn&#8217;t been working on the project weren&#8217;t enough to make me want to flog management, the rampant obliteration of the schedule and project design as a whole the moment someone finds something inconvenient would surely be enough to shove me over the edge reason.

On the HTG side of things, we could be doing a lot better. Right now, it feels as if the sand is slipping from beneath us and instead of worrying about how to get out, we&#8217;re pretending there isn&#8217;t any sand. No, we aren&#8217;t going out of business, but you might call it a criss of conscious as to the business mentality. I&#8217;ve been whoring out my &#8220;development&#8221; skills for a meager $25 / web-based form. Additional income is good, but form stuff is just doesn&#8217;t have any challenge to it. Additionally, we will be loosing one of our business partners. While I wish I could say it was a shock, I&#8217;m not surprised because I think it&#8217;s been coming for about 3 months for him. His tireless effort and amazing intelligence will be sorely missed.

The one redeeming tidbit of this week was Valentines Day. Sara was surprised and pleased so I don&#8217;t think I could ask for much more in that arena &#8230; other than to have the fricken Irish Pub carry their damned creme brul√©e again.

And the final straw for this week? I discovered that global warming is letting the terrorist win. How? Check back later and I&#8217;ll explain ;-).
