Ever since this jackass in L.A. stole money from me on a [Yahoo!][1](another story for later), I&#8217;ve been extremely cautious with all of my online dealings. Every retailer I go to gets Googled and Yahoo-ed to death to find all horrid reviews, angry clients, and unhappily shaven monkeys. Since I&#8217;ve been in the market for a new cell phone, one of the first places I looked was [eBay][2]. Item number [9522329615][3] was a Nokia E60 that I was considering purchasing; however, it was an international order and the guy only had 2 prior &#8220;good&#8221; rating. Another red flag went off when I noticed that the seller was talking about &#8220;buy it now&#8221; on an auction only product. So I sent an email asking about shipping and what the costs would be.

Now on top of poorly worded grammar and bad spelling, doesn&#8217;t that just reek of &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to bone you!&#8221; Who in the hell would setup and escrow account for a $350 product? To top it off, why the hell didn&#8217;t you answer my question you jackass??? I swear, even the damn scammers are getting fricken lazy these days. All that aside, I was glad I asked to confirm my assumptions because now if you go to the item, eBay has a really suspicious notice up about how the item just isn&#8217;t available anymore.

See if you think it&#8217;s a fake. [I bring you the original in all of it&#8217;s Google Cache spender][4], minus the fifty million pictures because I don&#8217;t want to upload and fix the code. It&#8217;s a fricken scammer, I don&#8217;t care that much :twisted:.
