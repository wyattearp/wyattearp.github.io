Oh man! I am so excited! I found a house that is awesome and they accepted my offer!!! You have no idea how pumped I am about this :-). It is so exciting I can&#8217;t even figure out what to write. The one thing that I know is that the deal is awesome, the location is awesome and yes, yes Gary Nue is screwed to hell and I will never have to deal with him ðŸ˜ˆ

I&#8217;ve gotten a better deal, a bigger house, a better location, better taxes and I have Gary&#8217;s bad Karma to thank for it.

So this one is for you Gary, thanks for being a jerk, I win.
