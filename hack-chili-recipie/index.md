Why it is called &#8216;Hacked Chili&#8217; you ask? Simple, I have no idea how to make chili, but this is my hack on how I think it should be done.

**Ingredients**  
1 Green Bell Pepper, diced  
1 Red Bell Pepper, diced  
1 Can of Chili Beans in hot chili sauce  
1-2 Cans of Rotel Green Chilis and Tomatoes  
1/3 Red Onion  
2 Tbsp Chili Poweder  
1-1/2 lbs Ground Sirloin  
1 Can Tomato Paste  
3 Cloves of Garlic (the little pieces, not the huge thing)  
1/3 Cup Franks RedHot (optional, but tasty)

**Instructions**

Brown the sirloin on low to medium heat using 1 Tbsp of chili powder.

In a Crockpot, combine the remain chili powder and everything else and cook on low for about how long it takes to brown the sirloin.

Drain grease from sirloin and add to Crockpot. You may wish to let the meat dry for a few more moments on a paper towel to remove more of the grease.

Stir it up and let it sit on low heat until you can&#8217;t wait anymore and then eat it.
