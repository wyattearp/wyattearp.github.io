Well, I have officially joined the ranks of those certified by Cisco. I&#8217;m officially a Cisco Certified Network Associate. This is basically the change you could expect to see:

The cool thing is that this might help me look much better to Xetron than I did previously, if they need that sort of thing. However, I&#8217;m also slightly disappointed. After contacting my boss and telling him of my efforts, it appears that there will be no reward such things. Now I&#8217;m not one of those people who needs a pat on the back every time I do something right, but when it&#8217;s discussed previously that there will be compensation for such achievements and then there is a blatant display of dodging previous discussions from management, it&#8217;s a little frustrating. Could just be another reason I am not satisfied with this company, who knows, but at least it should increase my Dice/Monster resume traffic as well as other potentials if Xetron falls through.
